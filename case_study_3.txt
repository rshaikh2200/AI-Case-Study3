Title: A Fatal Twist in Pseudohyperkalemia

The Case:
A 54-year-old man with a history of tobacco use presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of acute chest pain. The pain was intermittent, began 2-3 weeks prior, lasted several minutes to hours in duration, and radiated to his left arm. The patient thought the pain was related to his diet and put himself on a juice cleanse one week before his presentation. On arrival at the ED, he was afebrile, heart rate was 98 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure was 103/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was normal on supplemental oxygen. On physical examination, the patient had bibasilar rales and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. His 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block (RBBB). There was also prolongation of the QT interval, flattened T waves, and small U waves that were not recognized by either the machine or the ED physician. Laboratory tests were notable for hyponatremia to 126 mEq/L, hyperkalemia to 5.9 mEq/L, elevated creatinine to 1.4 mg/dL, moderately elevated troponin, and normal serum magnesium and calcium. The lab sample was reported as hemolyzed, but this finding was not recognized by the treating physician. Chest x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.

The patient subsequently developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at approximately 120 bpm. Cardiology was consulted and recommended initiation of heparin, amiodarone, and metoprolol. The patient also received treatment for hyperkalemia with albuterol, intravenous calcium, insulin with 50% dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, and furosemide. Soon after receiving these medications, he became unresponsive and pulseless. Torsades de pointes (TdP) was present on telemetry, though this was interpreted as ventricular fibrillation (VF) and treated with epinephrine, amiodarone, and sodium bicarbonate. Despite routine resuscitative efforts, return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved. Autopsy confirmed sudden cardiac arrest without myocardial infarction as the cause of death.

Title: Don’t Wait to Collect an Accurate Weight: A Case of Subtherapeutic Insulin Therapy

The Case:
A 16-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of dizziness, fatigue and a “high” reading on her home blood glucose monitor. Initial laboratory tests suggested diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), consistent with the clinician’s impression that the patient's insulin pump was malfunctioning. Despite aggressive treatment with insulin drip at a basal rate of 0.1 unit/kg, her blood glucose remained high and the anion gap closed much slower than expected, given that this patient had a history of DKA episodes that had previously responded rapidly to insulin infusion.

Late on day 2 of the admission, it was discovered that the admitting nurse and resident in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) had used the patient weight recorded in the ED to calculate and verify the insulin drip rate. Their rationale was that it was late, and the patient was tired when she arrived to the PICU. Her actual weight was 30 kg more than the weight documented in two different electronic health record (EHR) systems. Root cause analysis revealed that the weight in the ED had been marked as "stated" by the patient, which the patient verified when asked, but she had simply guessed at what she might weigh. Once the patient's weight was corrected and her insulin dose was adjusted, she improved quickly and her DKA resolved within 12 hours.

Title: Infection After Carpal Tunnel Surgery

The Case:
A woman presented for surgery on her right wrist as a treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. There were no reported complications during the operation, and the patient was discharged from the hospital the same day. Before discharge, the surgeon instructed her to return in 10 days for suture removal. The surgeon also told the patient not to soak her hand in water, which would reduce the risk of infection. A nurse provided written discharge instructions that stated, “Keep hand clean and dry until sutures removed; no soaking hand in water.” Within three or four days, the patient reported that her wrist felt “warm” to the touch, and the incision area was red. The patient contacted the surgeon’s office and spoke to the medical assistant (MA), but no action was taken. The patient called the surgeon’s office multiple times, asking for more or different pain medications, which were refused. The MA did not document each call but reportedly discussed each call with the surgeon. The MA stated that the patient never reported that the wound was red, hot, foul-smelling, swollen, or anything else suggesting an infection. Approximately 7 to 10 days after the operation, the patient returned for suture removal. The surgeon’s MA removed the patient’s sutures and noted that the wound was not infected or swollen. The surgeon’s physician assistant (PA) also examined the patient and did not find any remaining sutures, nor did she see any infection or redness. One day later, the patient called and asked to see the surgeon, but she was denied because the MA said her wrist was “fine.” The patient continued to report pain, swelling, and redness, noted that her wrist began to ooze at the incision, and reported an odd smell. She called several times, but no follow-up visit was scheduled. The MA claimed that the patient never mentioned redness or pain after the sutures were removed, and if she had reported such symptoms, the MA would have immediately brought the patient in and told the surgeon.

Two weeks after surgery, the patient went to an emergency department (ED) seeking treatment for worsening wrist pain. ED physicians diagnosed an infection, prescribed antibiotics, and told the patient to schedule an appointment with her surgeon. Three days after the ED visit, the patient spoke to the surgeon’s office and made a follow-up appointment for the next day. At that appointment, the surgeon recommended immediate surgery to treat the infection. The patient remained in the hospital for 11 days, during which she underwent two additional operations. She eventually recovered but lost significant use of her right hand.

Title: Dual Therapy Debacle

The Case:
An elderly man with a history of arthritis, benign prostatic hypertrophy with urinary obstruction, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and a long history of tobacco use presented to a local emergency department for chest pain. An electrocardiogram revealed a new anterior myocardial infarction, and a cardiac catheterization confirmed single-vessel disease isolated to the left anterior descending artery. The resulting percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulted in the placement of two drug-eluting stents. After stent placement, the patient was placed on triple anticoagulation therapy consisting of warfarin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin (ASA).

One month after placement, he received follow-up from a cardiologist and was informed he should remain on triple therapy for 6 months, at which time the warfarin would be discontinued. The plan was to continue the clopidogrel and aspirin (dual anticoagulation therapy [DAPT]) for an additional 6 months.

The patient saw his primary care provider (PCP) periodically over the next few years. These visits presented opportunities for his PCP to reconcile his medications. However, despite the plan to discontinue the DAPT after 1 year, the patient remained on this regimen 3 years after stent placement. On a preoperative visit for prostate surgery, he saw a cardiologist, who determined the patient had asymptomatic, stable coronary artery disease and affirmed his surgical candidacy. He further recommended discontinuing the clopidogrel, while continuing aspirin indefinitely. The cardiologist noted that an FDA Advisory Panel recommends just 12 months of DAPT after drug-eluting stent implantation, due to an increased risk of bleeding after 24 months of DAPT. The patient's PCP documented a telephone conversation with the patient in which he informed him to stop the clopidogrel and cleared him for prostate surgery. Nonetheless, the patient re-started the medication after the operation.

During yet another preoperative visit (this for removal of a skin cancer), it was discovered that the patient had re-started the clopidogrel. At this point, the clopidogrel was finally discontinued, and the PCP removed the drug from the patient's medication list in the electronic medical record.

Title: A Fumbled Handoff to Inpatient Rehab

The Case:
An 18-year-old man with no significant past medical history sustained a traumatic brain injury after a motor vehicle collision while driving intoxicated. The patient was admitted to a regional trauma center and required a decompressive craniectomy (removal of part of the skull bone) due to brain swelling as a result of his injury. He survived, but required prolonged care in the adult trauma intensive care unit (ICU).

His neurologic status remained poor, and he required a tracheostomy due to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation as well as placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. After a 3-week hospitalization the patient was transferred to a pediatric acute rehabilitation facility. He was scheduled to return to the trauma center for cranioplasty (repair of the skull defect) in 2 weeks. The plan was for him to continue to be weaned from the ventilator and receive physical and occupational therapy at the rehabilitation facility, likely for a period of several weeks to months.

The patient became increasingly agitated during his rehabilitation stay, and he eventually pulled on and broke his PEG tube. This necessitated a return to interventional radiology at the trauma center for removal of the retained PEG tube bulb. The patient was then admitted to the hospital for cranioplasty. He appeared to be doing well postoperatively and was transferred back to the pediatric acute rehabilitation center on postoperative day 2, which was a Friday afternoon.

The next day (Saturday), he had an acute change in mental status and new onset seizures. He was emergently transferred to the ICU at the pediatric hospital affiliated with the rehabilitation facility—not the adult facility where his surgeries had initially been performed. A stat head CT showed enlarged ventricles and a midline shift, indicating acute hydrocephalus (obstruction of the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid from around the brain). After realizing another surgical procedure would be needed, the patient was then transferred back to the trauma center, where an extraventricular drain was placed. After the procedure, the patient was then transferred back again to the rehabilitation facility, despite concerns on the part of the facility staff about the complexity of the patient's needs.

Title: Baffled by Botulinum Toxin

The Case:
A 5-year-old boy with a history of transverse myelitis with resultant spasticity of both lower extremities, gait abnormalities, neurogenic bladder, and neurogenic bowel presented to the rehabilitation medicine clinic for scheduled botulinum toxin (Botox) injections to his legs. He had been receiving Botox injections approximately every 3 months to his bilateral hamstrings, hip adductors, and gastrocnemius. Due to the patient's age and parent preference, he was given a dose of midazolam for sedation in the office prior to his injections.

The attending physician, fellow, and nurse went in the room to perform the injections. A time out was completed and the patient information, procedure, and sites were verified. About halfway through the 12 injections (2 to each muscle group on each side), the patient's mother said, "Wow, he is responding much better to the injections and sedating medications this time than he did 3 weeks ago." The attending and fellow were confused, as it had been 3monthssince his last injections in the rehabilitation medicine clinic. Upon further questioning, the mother clarified that the clinicians in the urology clinic had had Botox injected 3 weeks earlier for management of the patient's neurogenic bladder. The scheduled injections were completed, followed by a long discussion held with the mother about the risk of antibody formation and decreased efficacy from too-frequent injections.

Despite the concerns, the patient had no adverse effects and experienced good results from the injections. However, after the procedure, the attending and fellow reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) in an effort to understand how this error occurred. They realized that many specialties have begun to use Botox, and each one documented its use differently in the EMR. Whereas the rehabilitation medicine clinic entered a formal procedure note for each treatment, the urology clinic simply documented its injections in progress notes. Procedure notes appeared in a different area of the EMR and were not readily visible to clinicians accustomed to reviewing progress notes or test results.

Based on this review, clinic intake procedures were changed so that nurses now always ask about prior or recent Botox injections. In addition, the hospital's IT department created a clinical alert within the EMR that clearly states when the last order of Botox was given when a provider attempts to order Botox.
