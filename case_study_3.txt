Title: Dual Therapy Debacle

The Case:
An elderly man with a history of arthritis, benign prostatic hypertrophy with urinary obstruction, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and a long history of tobacco use presented to a local emergency department for chest pain. An electrocardiogram revealed a new anterior myocardial infarction, and a cardiac catheterization confirmed single-vessel disease isolated to the left anterior descending artery. The resulting percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulted in the placement of two drug-eluting stents. After stent placement, the patient was placed on triple anticoagulation therapy consisting of warfarin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin (ASA).

One month after placement, he received follow-up from a cardiologist and was informed he should remain on triple therapy for 6 months, at which time the warfarin would be discontinued. The plan was to continue the clopidogrel and aspirin (dual anticoagulation therapy [DAPT]) for an additional 6 months.

The patient saw his primary care provider (PCP) periodically over the next few years. These visits presented opportunities for his PCP to reconcile his medications. However, despite the plan to discontinue the DAPT after 1 year, the patient remained on this regimen 3 years after stent placement. On a preoperative visit for prostate surgery, he saw a cardiologist, who determined the patient had asymptomatic, stable coronary artery disease and affirmed his surgical candidacy. He further recommended discontinuing the clopidogrel, while continuing aspirin indefinitely. The cardiologist noted that an FDA Advisory Panel recommends just 12 months of DAPT after drug-eluting stent implantation, due to an increased risk of bleeding after 24 months of DAPT. The patient's PCP documented a telephone conversation with the patient in which he informed him to stop the clopidogrel and cleared him for prostate surgery. Nonetheless, the patient re-started the medication after the operation.

During yet another preoperative visit (this for removal of a skin cancer), it was discovered that the patient had re-started the clopidogrel. At this point, the clopidogrel was finally discontinued, and the PCP removed the drug from the patient's medication list in the electronic medical record.

Title: A Fumbled Handoff to Inpatient Rehab

The Case:
An 18-year-old man with no significant past medical history sustained a traumatic brain injury after a motor vehicle collision while driving intoxicated. The patient was admitted to a regional trauma center and required a decompressive craniectomy (removal of part of the skull bone) due to brain swelling as a result of his injury. He survived, but required prolonged care in the adult trauma intensive care unit (ICU).

His neurologic status remained poor, and he required a tracheostomy due to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation as well as placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. After a 3-week hospitalization the patient was transferred to a pediatric acute rehabilitation facility. He was scheduled to return to the trauma center for cranioplasty (repair of the skull defect) in 2 weeks. The plan was for him to continue to be weaned from the ventilator and receive physical and occupational therapy at the rehabilitation facility, likely for a period of several weeks to months.

The patient became increasingly agitated during his rehabilitation stay, and he eventually pulled on and broke his PEG tube. This necessitated a return to interventional radiology at the trauma center for removal of the retained PEG tube bulb. The patient was then admitted to the hospital for cranioplasty. He appeared to be doing well postoperatively and was transferred back to the pediatric acute rehabilitation center on postoperative day 2, which was a Friday afternoon.

The next day (Saturday), he had an acute change in mental status and new onset seizures. He was emergently transferred to the ICU at the pediatric hospital affiliated with the rehabilitation facility—not the adult facility where his surgeries had initially been performed. A stat head CT showed enlarged ventricles and a midline shift, indicating acute hydrocephalus (obstruction of the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid from around the brain). After realizing another surgical procedure would be needed, the patient was then transferred back to the trauma center, where an extraventricular drain was placed. After the procedure, the patient was then transferred back again to the rehabilitation facility, despite concerns on the part of the facility staff about the complexity of the patient's needs.

================================================================================

Title: Baffled by Botulinum Toxin

The Case:
A 5-year-old boy with a history of transverse myelitis with resultant spasticity of both lower extremities, gait abnormalities, neurogenic bladder, and neurogenic bowel presented to the rehabilitation medicine clinic for scheduled botulinum toxin (Botox) injections to his legs. He had been receiving Botox injections approximately every 3 months to his bilateral hamstrings, hip adductors, and gastrocnemius. Due to the patient's age and parent preference, he was given a dose of midazolam for sedation in the office prior to his injections.

The attending physician, fellow, and nurse went in the room to perform the injections. A time out was completed and the patient information, procedure, and sites were verified. About halfway through the 12 injections (2 to each muscle group on each side), the patient's mother said, "Wow, he is responding much better to the injections and sedating medications this time than he did 3 weeks ago." The attending and fellow were confused, as it had been 3monthssince his last injections in the rehabilitation medicine clinic. Upon further questioning, the mother clarified that the clinicians in the urology clinic had had Botox injected 3 weeks earlier for management of the patient's neurogenic bladder. The scheduled injections were completed, followed by a long discussion held with the mother about the risk of antibody formation and decreased efficacy from too-frequent injections.

Despite the concerns, the patient had no adverse effects and experienced good results from the injections. However, after the procedure, the attending and fellow reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) in an effort to understand how this error occurred. They realized that many specialties have begun to use Botox, and each one documented its use differently in the EMR. Whereas the rehabilitation medicine clinic entered a formal procedure note for each treatment, the urology clinic simply documented its injections in progress notes. Procedure notes appeared in a different area of the EMR and were not readily visible to clinicians accustomed to reviewing progress notes or test results.

Based on this review, clinic intake procedures were changed so that nurses now always ask about prior or recent Botox injections. In addition, the hospital's IT department created a clinical alert within the EMR that clearly states when the last order of Botox was given when a provider attempts to order Botox.

Title: Breathe Easy: Safe Tracheostomy Management

The Case:
A 75-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with sepsis due to multilobar pneumonia. He rapidly developed acute respiratory failure with evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome that required mechanical ventilation. The patient improved with initial treatments but on hospital day 12, a decision was made to place a tracheostomy given the anticipated need for a prolonged respiratory recovery period. The patient reported feeling more comfortable after the tracheostomy than he felt with the endotracheal tube.

A few days later, the patient became increasingly agitated due to delirium. He developed acute hypoxia and respiratory distress when it was noted that his tracheostomy was dislodged. The critical care physician on call was notified and he tried to reinsert the tracheostomy tube. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made and the patient ultimately went into cardiac arrest. The code team arrived and placed an endotracheal tube to secure the airway, which allowed successful resuscitation of the patient. The patient improved once again, had his tracheostomy replaced, and was eventually discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility for continued recovery.

================================================================================

Title: Privacy or Safety?

The Case:
A 64-year-old man with advanced dementia was admitted after being placed on a hold for grave disability. Family members noted he had a week of worsening confusion and agitation. The patient was undergoing a diagnostic workup for his altered mental status with a plan for a brain MRI if the etiology was still unclear. The cross-covering overnight resident was following up on the studies and placed an order for a brain MRI as discussed with the primary team at signout.

In this hospital, signout occurred with a paper-based system. In order to protect patient privacy, hospital policy dictated that signout documentation includes only patients' initials rather than more identifiable information such as full names or dates of birth. In this case, the patient requiring the brain MRI had the same initials as another patient on the same unit who also happened to have severe cognitive impairment from a traumatic brain injury. The cross-covering resident mixed up the two patients and placed the MRI order in the wrong chart. Because the order for a "brain MRI to evaluate worsening cognitive function" could apply to either patient, neither the bedside nurse nor radiologist noticed the error. The following morning, the primary team caught the error and the MRI was canceled and ordered for the correct patient. The near miss led to several discussions about optimizing signout processes while also protecting patient privacy.

================================================================================

Title: Inflicting Confusion

The Case:
A 26-year-old man with recently diagnosed Crohn disease presented to the emergency department with acute-onset abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and an inability to pass gas. His white blood cell count was elevated and imaging revealed a small bowel obstruction and ileitis consistent with a Crohn flare. The patient was admitted to the medicine team, started on empiric antibiotics, and placed on bowel rest. The medicine team recently managed a patient with Crohn disease and a similar presentation in which a gastroenterology (GI) consult recommended infliximab therapy. After they concluded that this flare was similar in its degree of acuity as the prior patient's, the medicine team preemptively initiated infliximab therapy and called for a GI consultation. GI recommended sending stool studies, including forClostridium difficileinfection (CDI), and suggested infliximab therapy should be initiated only after the stool studies were negative for infection. However, while an order was placed for stool studies, the primary team did not discontinue the infliximab. The next day, an hour into the infliximab infusion, a stool study returned and confirmed CDI. Infliximab was discontinued at that point, and the patient was treated for the CDI with eventual improvement in his symptoms.

================================================================================

Title: Anchoring Bias With Critical Implications

The Case:
A 61-year-old man with a history of stroke initially presented to his primary care physician (PCP) complaining of burning pain and numbness in his left foot for one month. The exam was notable for loss of sensation to his knee and a foot drop secondary to his prior stroke, but his pulses were intact with no other abnormalities noted. The PCP attributed the patient's pain and numbness to a peripheral neuropathy and referred him to podiatry.

The patient presented four more times to his PCP and twice to urgent care with a similar complaint of left foot pain. Each time he was referred to podiatry, but he never went to any podiatry appointments. During these visits, a complete extremity exam was not performed or documented, and the complaint was repeatedly attributed to his prior diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.

After multiple visits to his PCP and urgent care over a 2-month period, the patient presented to the emergency department with worsening symptoms. On exam his left lower leg was dusky in color with extreme tenderness to palpation and his pulses could not be palpated. A computed tomography angiogram revealed complete occlusion of the left superficial femoral artery secondary to atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. The patient required emergent bypass surgery of the left leg by vascular surgery. Unfortunately, due to ischemia (lack of blood flow from the arterial disease) of his leg, he developed multiple infections postoperatively and ultimately required an above-the-knee amputation.

The vascular surgeons who cared for the patient believed the patient's chronic burning pain was likely due to progressive peripheral arterial disease and not to a peripheral neuropathy.

================================================================================

Title: Unseen Perils of Urinary Catheters

The Case:
A 68-year-old man with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, seizures, cerebral vascular attack with hemiplegia, dysphagia, vascular dementia, speech disorder, benign hypertrophy of prostate with urinary retention, and monocular blindness was admitted to the hospital. He had no known allergies. The patient required total care for his activities of daily living. He received bolus feedings through a gastrostomy tube and required occasional suctioning of his tracheostomy. He was incontinent of bowel and bladder. He was alert and oriented to person and place. He was only able to answer simple yes-or-no questions.

During the day-to-evening shift change, a nursing assistant reported the patient had not voided all shift. The patient's bladder was not distended nor did he complain of discomfort. The hospitalist was called and ordered a urinary catheter insertion. Just prior to insertion of the catheter by a registered nurse (RN), the patient voided but the amount was not recorded. The RN reported this to the charge nurse, who informed the RN to proceed with the catheter insertion. The RN did so, but the procedure did not produce any urine. Since the patient had just voided, the RN assumed the patient's bladder was empty. Two hours later, the patient began to complain of discomfort. The RN attempted to irrigate the catheter but met resistance.

The charge nurse was called to assess the situation and found a blood clot in the tubing. The hospitalist was notified and ordered continuous bladder irrigation (CBI). The same RN removed the catheter and inserted a three-way catheter and the CBI began. An hour later, the patient's pain increased and his bladder was distended. The CBI intake and output were in equal amounts. The patient was transferred to emergency room. A urologist was called, who performed a bladder scan and discovered the urinary catheter was not in the bladder. The second catheter was removed and a new three-way catheter was inserted by the emergency room RN. Blood returned from the new catheter. It was irrigated until clear, and then CBI resumed. The patient was transferred back to the ward for observation and the next day he received two units of blood. CBI was continued for 2 days.

The patient experienced pain from a distended bladder, a misplaced catheter, and three catheter [re-]insertions. He was put at risk for complications that included urinary tract infection, urosepsis, and bladder rupture. The misplaced catheter caused trauma to the urethra and blood loss. The patient's wife filed a complaint with the facility, which prompted an in-house investigation. The investigation revealed that the nursing staff on duty were unaware of the policy regarding bladder scanning prior to catheter insertion or the CBI policy that required documentation of both input/output and urinary volume.

================================================================================

Title: Departure From Central Line Ritual

The Case:
A 55-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, pancreatic insufficiency, and alcohol and cocaine abuse was found unconscious by his neighbors. The patient had last been seen 2 days prior and complained of dizziness, thirst, and nausea. Emergency medical services found him unresponsive, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. He was intubated in the field. Upon arrival in the emergency department (ED), his pH was less than 6.8, carbon dioxide 37 mm Hg, oxygen 80 mm Hg, potassium 7.8 mEq/L, glucose 1400 mg/dL, lactate 11.2 mg/dL, and anion gap 42 mEq/L.

A right internal jugular line was placed for access. The resident who placed the line was relatively experienced in line placement but was unable to confirm placement with ultrasound. Instead he used manometry, which was not a part of the normal ED routine for line placement. He ultimately chose to pull the line. Just then, another trauma patient arrived, and the supervising attending physician left the room. The resident opened a second line insertion kit and restarted the process. Ultrasound was used to confirm correct placement. Upon flushing the line, it was noted that one of the ports was not working. The patient soon went into atrial tachycardia, which broke with adenosine. A chest radiograph was not obtained until later, after the patient went into ventricular fibrillation in the intensive care unit.

When the chest radiograph was finally completed, a retained wire was noted in the pulmonary artery. The interventional radiology team was consulted for wire removal. The retained wire likely caused a cardiac arrest, which required shocks, chest compressions, and cooling. After guidewire removal, the patient had no further episodes of arrhythmias, but experienced several other serious complications during a prolonged and stormy hospitalization.

================================================================================

Title: Transitions in Adolescent Medicine

The Case:
A 21-year-old woman with a history of Marfan syndrome complicated by aortic root dilation presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and was found to be pregnant. This was her second pregnancy, as she had had a therapeutic abortion 4 years previously. At that time, the patient was being followed by a pediatrician and a pediatric cardiologist. They had advised her of the high-risk nature of the pregnancy, including a 10% chance that she could have an aortic rupture during pregnancy. She decided to terminate the pregnancy and was advised that she should undergo surgical repair of her aortic root in the near future. Shortly thereafter, she turned 18 years old and was referred to an adult primary care physician and cardiologist for continued care. The patient never saw her new physicians and was never scheduled for the recommended cardiac surgery procedure. In fact, over the next 3 years she did not receive regular follow-up care at all, although she remained relatively healthy. She also never received pre-conception counseling or contraception, despite the risk to her health should she become pregnant.

Upon learning of the current pregnancy, the patient decided against another abortion. She was evaluated by adult cardiology and cardiac surgery, and she was advised to undergo an aortic root repair during her second trimester in order to minimize potential harm to the fetus while preserving her own health. Understandably, this decision caused significant anxiety for the patient and her family. She did undergo the procedure without complications and proceeded to have a healthy child at full term.

================================================================================

Title: Errors in Sepsis Management

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, and coronary artery disease presented to the hospital with left-sided abdominal pain and shortness of breath. She had been hospitalized for an exacerbation of her COPD 3 weeks prior but had been doing well at home on home oxygen. In the emergency department, she was ill appearing and in some respiratory distress. Her vital signs were notable for a temperature of 38.6° C, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/68 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86% on her baseline 2 liters. She was found to have decreased breath sounds at the left base and appeared dehydrated. She had a white blood cell count of 21.4 x 109/L, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL (up from a baseline of 1.3 mg/dL), a lactate of 3.9 mmol/L, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5. A chest radiograph revealed an infiltrate in the left lower lobe and she was diagnosed with pneumonia.

The patient was given 1 liter of normal saline in the emergency department. However, because of her history of pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease, she was not given any additional intravenous fluids. Blood cultures were drawn, and she received levofloxacin (administered approximately 3 hours after presentation).

She was admitted to the transitional care unit but slowly worsened. Twenty-four hours after admission, her blood cultures were growing methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and vancomycin was added to her antibiotic regimen. Despite the antibiotics and additional intravenous fluids, she continued to deteriorate. The patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation as well as septic shock requiring vasopressors. Her illness progressed and in discussions with her family, the decision was made to withdraw life-sustaining therapies and allow her to die peacefully. She died on hospital day 4 with her family at her bedside.

================================================================================

Title: Fire in the Hole!—An OR Fire

The Case:
A patient was taken to the operating room (OR) to undergo a planned laparoscopic subtotal colon resection for a biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. After resecting the segment of the colon where the tumor was located, the surgeon realized that he had accidentally lacerated the bladder. The laceration was located and sutured without difficulty, and the decision was made to irrigate the bladder to ensure its wall was intact. As the surgeons went about the task of bowel re-anastomosis (reconnection) in the darkened laparoscopic suite, the nurses set up the bladder irrigation equipment and began to flush the bladder with warm saline. None of the OR staff noticed that in the course of setting up the irrigation equipment, the circulating nurse had hung the large 3-liter bag of irrigating solution from the handle of the anesthesiologists' accessory "slave" monitor, directly above the major transformer that powers the device. As the procedure continued, the bag of saline began to drip directly into the power inverter. Suddenly, sparks and flames began shooting from the monitor tower, and the OR quickly filled with black smoke.

At this hospital, the OR staff conducted daily safety huddles and held timeouts before every procedure, both of which included physical verification and verbalization of fire safety measures available. In this case, the preoperative timeout included all members of the operating team agreeing on the current procedure's fire risk and the nurse verifying and verbalizing the location of the nearest fire extinguisher next to the OR door. The OR team immediately put this training into action. The anesthesiologist quickly shut down the purified oxygen, while the surgical team attempted to halt the procedure before they lost all visualization. The scrub nurse activated the overhead lights, grabbed the fire extinguisher near the room entrance, and was able to quickly put out the fire. Once it was extinguished and the monitor setup examined, the culprit was identified: the leaking bag of saline into the active transformer. Fortunately, neither the patient nor any member of the operating staff was injured as a result of this incident. The damaged equipment was promptly replaced and the procedure concluded without further incident.

================================================================================

Title: Dissecting the Presentation

The Case:
A 78-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension was in good health until she experienced acute onset of confusion, which resolved after a few minutes. Then she had two episodes of black and "tarry" foul-smelling diarrhea (i.e., melena, usually indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding). She was concerned about the symptoms so presented to the hospital. On presentation, she had no abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or focal weakness in her arms or legs.

Her physical examination was notable for tachycardia. Her mental status examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed mild anemia and new acute renal insufficiency. Chest radiograph revealed some right hilar fullness but was otherwise negative, and electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.

The patient was diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack and possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and she was admitted to a telemetry unit for monitoring and ongoing testing. She generally did well with no further confusion and resolving diarrhea. She did have a persistent sinus tachycardia.

On the morning of hospital day 2, she was found unconscious by the nursing staff and found to be in cardiac arrest; her cardiac rhythm was pulseless electrical activity. Despite maximal resuscitation efforts, the patient died.

Autopsy revealed the cause of death to be an acute aortic dissection (tear in the aorta) extending from the ascending aorta to the renal arteries, along with an acute hemothorax (blood in the chest cavity). The dissection was probably present on admission and the tear in the aorta had impaired blood flow leading to all of her symptoms, including the transient ischemic attack, the gastrointestinal bleeding, and the renal failure. The dissection likely worsened while the patient was hospitalized, and its rupture into her chest cavity was the terminal event.

================================================================================

Title: Transition to Nowhere

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer, poorly controlled myotonic dystrophy, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease was admitted to the hospital with anuric acute kidney injury in the setting of angiotensin receptor blocker overdose. The patient initially required intensive care unit admission for urgent hemodialysis before having a return of renal function to his previous baseline. Discharge planning efforts created a series of challenges.

The patient was new to this health system (having recently moved to the area), had no primary care provider established yet, and needed close follow-up care. The inpatient team desired a 1-week follow-up appointment to check renal function, potentially re-start medications held during hospitalization because of the renal failure, and ensure entry into the primary and specialty care systems. The next available primary care appointment was in 6 weeks, and the urgent care clinic only offered same-day appointments, leaving no way to schedule a visit there prior to discharge. The patient was instructed to call the urgent care clinic in 1 week for a same-day appointment. However, he never made it to the clinic. Nearly 2 weeks later, he presented to the emergency department with poorly controlled hypertension. Once his renal function was assessed and found to be back to baseline, his previously held antihypertensives were re-started, and he was sent home once again with the original primary care appointment now only a few weeks away.

================================================================================

Title: Medication Mix-Up: From Bad to Worse

The Case:
A 69-year-old man with chronic kidney disease and essential hypertension was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, headache, and accelerated hypertension. Of note, he had missed taking several days of his regular medications. Upon admission, his blood pressure was 218/126 mm Hg with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a patient in mild discomfort, but no distress, presence of an S4 (indicating reduced ventricular wall compliance), and otherwise normal cardiopulmonary and neurologic examination. His electrocardiograph revealed significant left ventricular hypertrophy but no acute ischemic changes. His chest radiograph demonstrated a mildly enlarged heart, but no widened mediastinum or pulmonary edema. Troponin levels were negative, and his kidney function tests were stable. After starting a nitroglycerin drip, it was decided his outpatient medications should be re-started gradually. One of his antihypertensive medications was minoxidil, and his outpatient dose of 7.5 mg per day was ordered via the electronic health record. However, midodrine 2.5 mg tablets x 3, not minoxidil 2.5 mg tablets x 3 ultimately arrived on the medical unit.

While the medication mix-up was not identified by the dispensing pharmacist, the nurse responsible for administering medications noticed that the dispensed medication differed from what had been ordered. She sought out the medical team, who quickly clarified that the intended medication was minoxidil, not midodrine. Midodrine hydrochloride is a vasopressor/antihypotensive agent used in treating orthostatic hypotension. Had this patient received midodrine in the setting of accelerated hypertension and chest pain, his condition could have worsened significantly due to this pharmacological effect.

================================================================================

Title: Critical Opportunity Lost

The Case:
A 55-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with new onset chest pain. She reported eating a heavy dinner the previous night in celebration of her anniversary. She initially attributed her chest pain to acid reflux, but when the pain persisted, she arrived at the ED for further evaluation. During her ED visit, her symptoms resolved with sublingual nitroglycerine and a "GI cocktail" (an oral antacid/anesthetic combination sometimes used to treat possible reflux), and her electrocardiogram was unremarkable. She felt back to "normal" so the clinicians caring for her in an observation unit arranged for a stress test the following morning.

When the patient arrived for her stress test, she reported feeling well with no further chest pain. Approximately 3 minutes into her stress test, she collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. The case was reviewed by the hospital's quality committee, whose members noted that the providers in the observation unit failed to note an elevated troponin prior to discharge. The facility recently transitioned to a new electronic health record and questions were raised about how critical or panic lab values should be managed. Providers felt that a lack of such a system had contributed to the error in this patient's care.

================================================================================

Title: Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right (Kidney)

The Case:
A 53-year-old man presented to Hospital A with abdominal pain and hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a suspected renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney. He was transferred to Hospital B for surgical management.

All of the medical records from Hospital A documented a left-sided tumor—the wrong side. The CT scan from Hospital A was not available at the time of the transfer and repeat imaging was not obtained by the providers at Hospital B.

At the time of surgery, the surgeon was asked if the absence of an available image should preclude progressing with the surgery. He decided to proceed and, based on the available information, removed the left kidney.

The day following the surgery, the pathologist contacted the surgeon to report no evidence of cancer. The surgeon then reviewed the initial CT scan and realized his mistake. The patient underwent a second surgical procedure to remove the right kidney (which was found to have renal cell carcinoma). Having lost both kidneys, the patient was then dependent on dialysis, and because of the cancer, he was not a candidate for kidney transplant.

================================================================================

Title: Haste Makes Care Unsafe

The Case:
An 80-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation underwent a combined elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and Maze procedure (ablation of atrial fibrillation). A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter was placed after induction of anesthesia in order to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status. The surgery was proceeding uneventfully when the surgeon requested that the PA catheter be pulled back from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle when he performed the actual ablation. At that point, the surgeon was informed that another patient in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) would require an emergency CABG. The surgeon was the only cardiac surgeon available that day, and there was also only one cardiac anesthesia team. The surgeon and attending anesthesiologist decided to begin the emergency CABG as soon as possible after completing the current procedure.

The remainder of the CABG was completed without incident, and the patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) easily, but this process took nearly another hour. By this point, the second patient was already being brought to another operating room (OR), and the team had received several pages about his clinical status. The surgeon was anxious to start the second case as soon as possible, so in order to speed up the transfer process, the attending anesthesiologist refloated the PA catheter himself back into the pulmonary artery, which required re-inflating the catheter's balloon. As soon as this was completed, the anesthesiologist rushed to the other OR in order to begin the emergency CABG. An anesthesia resident accompanied the first patient to the ICU.

In the ICU, the nurse who assumed care of the patient noticed that the PA catheter waveform was dampened (the tracing was flat and did not vary with the cardiac cycle). Further check by him and the anesthesia resident revealed that the PA catheter balloon was still inflated, and probably had been so the entire time after refloating. This was potentially very dangerous, as leaving the balloon inflated could have caused catastrophic damage to the pulmonary artery. Fortunately, the nurse recognized the situation quickly, and the resident deflated the balloon and withdrew the PA catheter without the patient experiencing any harm. The anesthesia resident realized that she had not discussed the PA catheter explicitly (including its inflation status) with the attending prior to transferring the patient out of the OR.

================================================================================

Title: Bowel Injury After Laparoscopic Surgery

The Case:
A 30-year-old man presented to the hospital for a scheduled laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with mesh placement. The patient had no significant past medical history and did not take any home medications. He was expected to stay a few hours after the surgery and then be released the same day.

The surgery went uneventfully, but after surgery, the patient continued to have high levels of pain at the surgical site. He was then admitted to the hospital for monitoring and pain control. As the team that performed the surgery had already left for the day, a resident physician who was unfamiliar with the patient provided overnight coverage. The night resident was called to the patient's bedside multiple times overnight by the charge nurse to address the patient's pain, and the resident ordered additional intravenous pain medication. When the primary surgical team arrived in the morning, they increased the patient's standing pain medication regimen and he was expected to be released that day or the next at the latest.

The patient remained in sustained pain and the surgical team was called to the bedside multiple times over the next 2 days. His physical examination was documented as unremarkable, and he was started on a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump with hydromorphone. On postoperative day 2, the patient was weaned off the PCA and started on a clear liquid diet. However, the next day, he continued to have abdominal pain and became increasingly tachycardic with slight abdominal distention and a low-grade fever. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was ordered, and the patient was found to have a bowel perforation. He was sent urgently back into the operating room in order to fix the perforation, and postoperatively required a lengthy stay in the intensive care unit due to septicemia. He did eventually recover and was discharged home.

================================================================================

Title: Monitoring Fetal Health

The Case:
A 29-year-old woman had an uncomplicated pregnancy with a healthy fetus and presented to the hospital at term (40 weeks) in early labor. She progressed slowly over the first night. By the next morning, she had a completely dilated cervix and was ready to push. She pushed for approximately 2 hours without any difficulty or any sign of problems with the fetus. Unfortunately, when the infant was born, he was cyanotic and flaccid with very low Apgar scores. An arterial blood gas at the time showed a pH of 6.70 (normal: 7.25–7.35), a profound acidosis. The infant required extensive resuscitation but survived and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.

The infant subsequently had multiple seizures typical of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (brain injury from inadequate oxygenation of the brain that occurred during childbirth) and other problems related to the complicated delivery. He spent a month in the neonatal intensive care unit before being transferred to a neuro-rehabilitation unit. He is likely to be severely disabled for the remainder of his life.

A root cause analysis of the case found that the mother had been appropriately monitored and had not shown any evidence of distress. The fetus had been monitored using the standard fetal heart rate tracings throughout the time of labor. The fetal heart rate tracings had shown evidence of Category 2 and 3 abnormalities (moderate-to-severe fetal distress) for at least 90 minutes prior to the delivery. These abnormalities, which likely would have prompted an urgent cesarean delivery, had not been recognized by any of the physicians or nursing staff.

In this institution, continuous fetal heart monitoring of all of the women in labor was displayed centrally on a large 40-inch monitor at the nurses' station. On this screen, the individual fetal heart monitoring strips for the 16 rooms were displayed continuously in small windows. Two nurses at the nursing station were assigned to watch the monitor at the time of the concerning abnormalities. When asked about the incident, they both replied that they "just didn't see the bad tracings" and commented how difficult it can be sometimes to identify abnormalities and to continuously watch all 16 small windows. The responsible obstetrician was busy throughout the period of abnormal tracings with another complicated childbirth.

Title: Medical Devices in the "Wild"

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease, diabetes, chronic pain, arthritis, and hyperlipidemia was admitted to the hospital with a CHF exacerbation manifesting as lower extremity edema and weight gain. At baseline, he was able to function independently and perform all activities of daily living. The patient was treated with diuretics, fluid restriction, and was given dietary and medication education. After a short period of treatment, his swelling improved and he was able to ambulate on the hospital ward without difficulty. The medical team was preparing the patient for discharge the following day.

That afternoon, the patient was lying in bed watching television when his nurse came into the room to assess him. The bed was low to the ground and locked in position, so she raised the bed up to perform her assessment. The patient had sequential compression devices (SCDs) in place to prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT). When the nurse raised the bed, unbeknownst to her, the tubing for the SCDs caught on the bed wheel lock and unlocked the bed. After completing her assessment, the nurse left the room. Having been told he should ambulate several times daily, the patient then sat up on the side of the bed and attempted to stand. In doing so, he pushed down on the bed with his hands. When he did this, the bed rolled out from under him and he fell onto his left side. He immediately complained of hip pain, and on radiographs was found to have a broken left hip.

The next day he went to surgery for planned open reduction and internal fixation of his hip fracture. Unfortunately, he developed respiratory issues and had to be transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring postoperatively. He did improve temporarily, but despite receiving appropriate DVT prophylaxis, one week after surgery he suddenly experienced a cardiac arrest and was found to have a massive pulmonary embolism. He was briefly resuscitated but died a short time later.

The unit where the fall occurred called a multidisciplinary "fall huddle" to reenact the circumstances of the incident. The nurse was certain the bed was locked, but a technician noticed that the SCD tubing had fallen around the wheel and brake of the bed. During the reenactment, the staff realized it was possible for the tubing to catch the brake and unlock the bed without being noticed. The hospital's patient safety department immediately informed the company that manufactured the beds and the SCD equipment. The SCDs were replaced with newer equipment that had shorter tubing that could not wrap around the bed brake and unlock it inadvertently.

================================================================================

Title: Ebola: Are We Ready?

The Case:
A 28-year-old man, well-appearing but pale, walked into the emergency department (ED) on a Wednesday afternoon at 3 PM complaining of nausea, vomiting, and fever since morning. The patient stated that he was at a potluck the night before and thought he ate something that made him sick because he had a foul tasting potato salad. He was unsure if anyone else got sick. The patient glanced at the sign prominently posted at the triage desk. "Tell us if you have traveled outside the United States in the past month." He did not volunteer any information, but when the triage nurse asked him directly, he reported that he returned the previous week from Sierra Leone, where he was volunteering with Doctors Without Borders handling patient intake. Because of this history, the nurse initiated an isolation protocol for patients with symptoms and travel history consistent with possible exposure to Ebola. The triage nurse donned a mask and handed one to the patient, asking him to don it as well. She did not touch him but asked him to go with her to a decontamination room and to wait there until staff could don personal protective equipment (PPE). The patient was also instructed to don a blue plastic gown over his street clothes. He waited in the decontamination room for 20 minutes.

An ED physician and nurse, both wearing full PPE, introduced themselves to the patient and explained why they were dressed in coveralls, powered air purifying respirators, double gloves, and protective leg and shoe covers. They took a history and assisted the patient to a gurney. Outside the room, two security officers cleared the corridor. The physician and nurse pushed the gurney down the secured hallway toward the elevators where they would go up to an isolation room. There seemed to be confusion as to which elevators should be used. At that moment three different elevators arrived on the ground floor, more than 30 staff members (at their shift change) exited the elevators to go home and were surprised to see the two human silhouettes covered head-to-toe in yellow and white spacesuits pushing a gurney occupied by a pale young man, now garbed in an isolation gown, bonnet, and mask, and in considerable distress with vomiting. As the patient arrived in the isolation room, the ED nurse was asked to start an IV, draw blood, and insert a Foley catheter. As the nurse gathered supplies and cannulated the peripheral vein, she asked, "Where is the transfer set?" referring to an equipment tray used in the ED to draw blood from a peripheral IV. As the clinicians soon discovered, this set was not available on the patient unit. The blood was successfully collected using available equipment, yet the procedure to send it to the laboratory was not clear. The specimen was placed in a double biohazard bag and left in the room pending additional instructions about how to transport it to the laboratory.

The critical care team, two intensivists and two nurses, arrived in the isolation room. A trained observer assisted the critical care team as they donned their PPE, a process that took more than 20 minutes. A warm handoff was provided by the ED team as they exited. A warm handoff includes an in-person summary of the patient's history, symptoms, and ED care and decision-making, with an opportunity for the critical care team to ask questions. As the critical care team turned to the patient, he vomited again, became tachycardic and hypotensive, and his oxygen saturation dropped and did not respond to supplemental oxygen. The intensive care unit (ICU) physicians decided the patient needed central venous access and requested supplies and ultrasound. While they often supervise resident and fellow insertions of central lines, attending physicians in the ICU seldom perform insertion themselves. Unfamiliar with the central line kit, they struggled but successfully put a triple-lumen catheter in the internal jugular vein using ultrasound guidance. Sterile technique was breached multiple times as they navigated the central line insertion process in their bulky PPE. At several points in the process as they reached for supplies, their backs were to the patient. An airway was never secured.

Fortunately, this case was only a simulation. Multiple experts observed and provided feedback on the process.

Although the patient was not harmed, he was placed at risk for development of a central line–associated bloodstream infection. Hospital faculty and staff were placed at risk of contamination with Ebola. Yet, this simulation took place in a hospital that was "ready" for a patient with Ebola. The hospital had developed and disseminated guidelines for caregivers and had trained them especially on safe PPE donning and doffing.

Title: No BP During NIBP

The Case:
An otherwise healthy 49-year-old man with atrial fibrillation was scheduled for ablation in the catheterization laboratory under general endotracheal anesthesia. The procedure lasted 7 hours. Per American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines, monitoring included continuous electrocardiography, oxygen saturation, end tidal carbon dioxide, as well as noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement every 5 minutes. The patient was extremely stable with values hardly changing over time. Inadvertently between 4 PM and 5 PM, the NIBP stopped "cycling," but this was not recognized. When the attending anesthesiologist took over the case at the end of the certified registered nurse anesthetist's (CRNA) shift, she noticed that the "graphic trends" tab on the monitor had a straight line for heart rate and oxygen saturation (indicating no change over time) and a blank space for the NIBP. A lookup of numerical trend was done and it showed that the last NIBP recording was more than 60 minutes earlier. After discovering the error, the case continued without any problem. The patient was extubated and discharged home the next day as planned. The patient was informed about the mistake and he accepted it as human error.

Reviewing the case revealed that certain safety checks that are routine in the operating room (OR) do not routinely occur in the cardiac catheterization laboratory setting in this hospital. First, OR attending physicians are expected to frequently check the progress of the case. Second, the automated anesthesia record in the OR shows "blank" if there are no new NIBP recordings. Third, the OR doctors' work area has a central monitor feed that the attendings watch when they do paperwork. Fourth, the OR monitors "gray" out NIBP value if the cuff is not cycling. These features are not in place for out-of-OR cases. In addition, the monitor for the catheterization laboratory was a different make and model from those in the OR, and the CRNA was unfamiliar with the menu and knobs. The anesthesia record was manual, and the CRNA kept documenting the same reading for a whole hour. Human factors such as fatigue and lack of vigilance in a very stable case also contributed to the error.

================================================================================

Title: Too Much, Too Fast

The Case:
A 68-year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for fever, tachycardia, and increased respiratory secretions. His ALS was complicated by ventilator-dependence requiring a tracheostomy, along with comorbidities that included coronary artery disease and a prior bypass graft, insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Initial physical examination and laboratory studies were suggestive of pneumonia with sepsis and poorly controlled hyperglycemia. His electrolytes were notable for sodium of 150 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mEq/L, and glucose of 421 mg/dL. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation while also being placed on an insulin infusion for his hyperglycemia.

Over the first few hours of hospitalization, his hemodynamics and glycemic control markedly improved. A repeat potassium level returned low at 2.7 mEq/L. Providers ordered 120 mEq of oral potassium replacement via a feeding tube and 60 mEq of intravenous potassium via a central line at 20 mEq/hour. While on the third bag of the potassium infusion, the patient went into cardiac arrest and advanced cardiovascular life support measures were delivered. Point-of-care testing showed potassium was critically elevated at greater than 9.0 mEq/L. Despite efforts to aggressively treat the hyperkalemia, resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.

================================================================================

Title: Benefits vs. Risks of Intraosseous Vascular Access

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with a history of asthma, congestive heart failure, and medication noncompliance presented to the emergency department with 2 weeks of lower extremity edema, fatigue, and progressively worsening dyspnea. She reported shortness of breath at rest and with exertion, as well as a dry cough. On initial examination, she was wheezing and had notable right lower extremity erythema and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema greater on the right side with weeping from her skin. She was admitted for asthma exacerbation and lower extremity cellulitis. She improved with fluids, albuterol nebulizers, methylprednisolone, and ceftriaxone/doxycycline. During her next 2 hospital days, she had a lower extremity ultrasound that was negative for a deep vein thrombosis and a transthoracic echocardiogram that was normal except for biatrial enlargement.

At midnight of her second hospital day, the patient's son noted that his mother was feeling dizzy. Four hours later, the patient suddenly became bradycardic to a heart rate of 20 beats per minute. Walking to the bathroom, she was notably dyspneic, with an oxygen saturation of 87%. She then became unresponsive. Her initial rhythm was pulseless electrical activity. During the code, a senior resident placed an intraosseous (IO) line in the left tibia following several unsuccessful attempts to obtain peripheral venous access. After 10 minutes of chest compressions and advanced cardiovascular life support protocol, spontaneous circulation returned and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Three hours after the IO line was placed, a nurse notified the primary team that the left leg was a dusky purple, and on examination the leg was bluish and tensely edematous with sluggish distal pulses. Vascular surgery diagnosed compartment syndrome, removed the IO line, and performed a bedside fasciotomy later that morning. The fasciotomy wounds were slow to heal and required ongoing complex care. After 2 months in the ICU and multiple complications, the patient was discharged.

================================================================================

Title: Liver Biopsy: Proceed With Caution

The Case:
A 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple malignancies, including osteosarcoma and recurrent breast cancer, presented to an emergency department with jaundice and epigastric pain. An abdominal ultrasound revealed several liver masses and subsequent imaging was consistent with metastatic malignancy of unknown primary source. The patient was admitted directly for an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy. Prior to the procedure, the patient required platelet transfusions, which increased her admitting platelet count of 5000/μL to 71,000/μL (reference range: 150,000–400,000/μL) prior to biopsy. Immediately after the procedure, she was transferred to the floor and began complaining about new abdominal pain. Her blood pressure was noted to be lower than baseline at 88/55 mm Hg, so a call was placed to the covering in-house physician. The physician believed that pain was common after such biopsies and ordered a dose of analgesics, which improved the patient's symptoms.

Over the next 2 hours, the patient's pain worsened and she became increasingly somnolent. When the bedside nurse returned to assess her pain, she found the patient unresponsive and called a code blue. The patient had pulseless electrical activity and the initial assessment also revealed a hematocrit of 14%, a decrease from 28% before the procedure. A massive transfusion protocol was initiated. The patient had a prolonged resuscitation and was transferred to the intensive care unit where she later died of multi-organ failure. The delay in recognizing the post-procedure intraperitoneal hemorrhage led to a detailed review by the hospital's quality committee. The protocols for managing patients following a liver biopsy were noted to be clearer in the outpatient setting where most procedures take place. No such protocols were in place for the less common inpatient liver biopsy at this facility.

================================================================================

Title: Pitfalls in Diagnosing Necrotizing Fasciitis

The Case:
A 49-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department (ED) after falling from his truck at work 3 days before. He had gone to a different ED the day prior with diffuse pain on his left side (the side of his impact) and was given nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and sent home. He presented to this new ED with persistent and worsening left arm, chest, abdomen, and thigh pain.

On physical examination, he was afebrile but tachycardic. He had diffuse, tender ecchymoses involving his left shoulder, upper chest, lateral abdomen, and thigh. Although the ED physicians felt he had simple bruising from the fall, they noted that he was in severe pain requiring intravenous (IV) opiates and that he was unable to independently ambulate. Because of these symptoms, blood tests were obtained and results showed a white blood cell count of 2.8 × 109/L (normal range: 3.5–10.5 × 109/L) and acute renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL). A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed "induration in the left quadriceps muscle and fluid layering in the abdominal wall." He was seen by the trauma surgical service, who felt the findings were due to diffuse bruising. The patient was admitted to an internal medicine service.

Due to ED crowding, he remained in the ED overnight, receiving only IV fluids and opiates for his pain. Over the course of the night, his pain worsened and he had a persistent tachycardia. Early morning lab results showed a white blood cell count of 1.6 × 109/L, a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, a creatine kinase of 2650 U/L (normal range 55–170 U/L) (evidence of muscle breakdown), and a lactate of 6.2 mg/dL (normal range 0.5–2.2 mmol/L) (evidence of tissue hypoxia). He was seen by the internal medicine team mid-morning and diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis from trauma and acute renal failure. He continued to receive IV fluids. His pain had become so severe that he was switched to hydromorphone hydrochloride, administered through a patient-controlled analgesia pump.

Later that day, the patient had progressive respiratory distress and developed septic shock. He was re-evaluated by the surgical service and felt to have probable necrotizing fasciitis with pyomyositis. He was urgently taken to the operating room, where he required debridement of 7300 cm/sq (an area roughly 2 ft by 4 ft) of skin and soft tissue from his left arm and axilla, anterior chest wall, abdominal wall, thigh, and leg.

After surgery, he was progressively hypotensive despite multiple vasopressors. He developed multi-organ dysfunction and ultimately, after discussions with his family, care was withdrawn and he died peacefully. He underwent autopsy, which showed necrotizing fasciitis with pyomyositis secondary to methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus.

================================================================================

Title: May I Have Another?—Medication Error

The Case:
A 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after having a seizure. Upon admission, the patient, a pharmacology-trained research PhD, stated that this was his first seizure. His review of symptoms and physical examination were unremarkable. He denied the use of alcohol, caffeine products, and other recreational drugs; his only regular medications were multivitamins. He did volunteer that he typically had difficulty falling asleep, often taking a single dose of diphenhydramine 25 mg at bedtime. He noted that the diphenhydramine made him somewhat drowsy, but not enough to fall asleep.

In further discussion with the patient, he revealed that these sleep difficulties had substantially increased in the past few weeks to the point that he self-referred to a local sleep disorder program. During his first visit to the program, he was given a prescription for zolpidem. The patient brought the medication to the hospital; review of the label confirmed that the prescription was for zolpidem 10 mg. The printed instructions stated, "Zolpidem 10 mg, 1 at bedtime; if ineffective, take another." Based on his interpretation of these instructions, the patient revealed that he had been regularly taking up to 10 tablets of zolpidem every night and had recently ran out of his supply. A few days after abruptly stopping the medication, he experienced the seizure.

================================================================================

Title: Wandering Off the Floors: Safety and Security Risks of Patient Wandering

The Case:
A 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted for management of alcohol withdrawal. After several days of aggressive treatment, the patient was improving and was being managed on the medical-surgical floor. Initially he had been confused in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, but by hospital day 6 his mental status was clear and the patient was nearing discharge.

On the morning of hospital day 6, the patient was feeling "cooped up" and "needed a change of scenery" and a cigarette. He wandered off the floor without informing his bedside nurse or any other health care provider, and he left the hospital grounds.

When he returned to his room an hour later, the patient complained of new right arm pain. He was examined and the physician found evidence of diffuse bruising of his right arm. A subsequent radiograph revealed a fractured humerus (bone of the upper arm). After the radiography results were revealed to the patient, he acknowledged that he had fallen while he was off the floor.

He was treated for his fracture and the institution began to consider a policy regarding patients leaving the unit while hospitalized.

================================================================================

Title: CVC Removal: A Procedure Like Any Other

The Case:
A 27-year-old man with a history of Behçet disease and recurrent liver abscesses was admitted to the hospital for a prolonged intravenous antibiotic course for treatment of the abscesses. Due to difficult peripheral venous access, a right internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) was placed. After completion of the antibiotic course, the CVC was removed and the patient was discharged 30 minutes later. He subsequently experienced acute onset of shortness of breath associated with a "whistling sound" from his neck. He re-presented to the emergency department with hypoxia and a significant Alveolar–arterial gradient, requiring 15 L high-flow oxygen to maintain his oxygen saturation. A tentative diagnosis of air embolism was made, and computed tomography of the chest did not reveal other abnormalities that would explain his hypoxia, such as pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The patient had a brief stay in the intensive care unit and improved rapidly.

On review of the case, it was determined that the CVC had been removed while the patient was in an upright position, and that the removal site was not covered with an occlusive dressing. The physician who removed the CVC had completed the required central line training module a year earlier, which included one slide on proper removal technique. The physician was not aware that the hospital CVC removal protocol specified the use of a CVC removal kit, and that the kit was available on the ward. The kit contained instructions for the procedure and the appropriate materials, including the occlusive dressing.

================================================================================

Title: Medication Reconciliation With a Twist (or Dare We Say, a Patch?)

The Case:
An 80-year-old woman with a history of dementia was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and diagnosed with a bowel obstruction, secondary to a new diagnosis of colon cancer. She underwent an uncomplicated surgical resection of the colon cancer with relief of the obstruction. Postoperatively she developed confusion and agitation consistent with acute delirium.

At this hospital, a geriatric psychiatry consulting service was available to help manage postoperative delirium and was consulted by the surgical service. As part of their evaluation, they reviewed the patient's current and prior medications to determine possible triggers and optimize treatment. They spoke directly with the family and reviewed the official medication reconciliation list, which a pharmacist had documented at admission. Although the family stated that the patient was on a "memory medicine," the reconciliation list did not include any dementia medication. Based on this discrepancy, the consulting service contacted the outpatient pharmacy and learned the patient was prescribed a cholinesterase inhibitor patch (a medication for dementia), to be replaced weekly. She had not been prescribed the drug during the hospital stay, and the last patch had been placed more than a week earlier. Although many factors likely contributed to postoperative delirium, the geriatrics service felt that abrupt withdrawal of the cholinesterase inhibitor contributed to the episode.

================================================================================

Title: Discontinued Medications: Are They Really Discontinued?

The Case:
A 69-year-old man with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and associated cerebrovascular accident (CVA) treated with warfarin and aspirin, presented to the emergency department (ED) with a severe headache. A STAT computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral subdural hematomas. His international normalized ratio (INR) was determined to be supratherapeutic at 4.9. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring of his neurologic status. After resolution of the severe headache, warfarin was restarted because of the high risk associated with his previous CVA (CHADS2 score of 3).

One day after re-initiation of his warfarin, he experienced a recurrence of his subdural hematoma. The warfarin was discontinued, the patient stabilized clinically, and he was later discharged home. Although warfarin was not included on his Discharge Medication list, a few days after returning home the patient received warfarin via mail order from his outpatient pharmacy. While confused by the receipt of the warfarin, the patient restarted the medication. At his follow-up appointment he was noted to have an elevated INR. Recognizing the elevated INR was a result of the patient's re-initiation of warfarin, a repeat head CT was performed which fortunately was negative for recurrent hemorrhage. In response to these events, warfarin was added to his allergy list with the comment "Never to be resumed." Regardless, when the primary care provider (PCP) contacted the pharmacy weeks later, warfarin remained on the active medication list, with available refills. The PCP had it removed from this list.

================================================================================

Title: Raise the Bar

The Case:
A 57-year-old man presented to an ambulatory surgery center for excision of a right groin lipoma. The patient was seen and evaluated by an anesthesiologist who was new to the center. After discussing anesthetic options with the patient, the physician proceeded with regional anesthesia and performed a right iliac block in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken to the operating room, where he awaited the arrival of the surgeon. Without alerting the nurse, the patient tried to get up to use the restroom, but—because his leg was now numb—fell and hit his head on the ground. After hearing the fall, the nurse came quickly to evaluate and, given complaints of acute neck pain, the patient was transferred to the local emergency room. A heated interaction ensued between the anesthesiologist and nurse around why certain safety measures hadn't been taken to protect the patient. Ultimately, the patient didn't experience any significant injury and he had his lipoma removed the following week.

The quality review committee at the ambulatory surgery center investigated the events. It was noted that the rails of the patient's bed were not raised after the block was placed, largely because the nurses were unaware that the procedure had been performed by the anesthesiologist. Because of this poor communication, the nurse assumed that the block would be placed in the operating room (as was done by other anesthesiologists on staff). Moreover, she reported being unfamiliar with the use of regional blocks in general.

================================================================================

Title: Clostridium Difficile Relapse Secondary to Medication Access Issue

The Case:
A 24-year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and diffuse B-cell lymphoma, actively receiving chemotherapy, was admitted with diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient reported recent antibiotic use, and a stool sample was positive forClostridium difficiletoxin. As she had prior episodes ofClostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD), she was treated with oral vancomycin. She improved quickly and was discharged with a plan to complete a 14-day course of oral vancomycin. After being discharged, the patient took her discharge prescriptions to her usual retail pharmacy. However, the pharmacy informed her that the oral vancomycin solution had not been approved by her insurance, and she was unable to afford the considerable cost of paying for the medication out of pocket.

The patient contacted her primary care physician, and over the next 4 days, the nurses at the patient's primary care clinic spent many hours on the phone attempting to obtain coverage for the vancomycin solution. Despite contacting the medical director of the insurance plan, the approval was never finalized and during this time the patient received no treatment. Soon, her symptoms recurred. She was instructed to return to the emergency department, where a computed tomography scan was suggestive of toxic megacolon (marked dilation and inflammation of the colon secondary to uncontrolled infection). She was readmitted and re-started on oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole for treatment of severe CDAD. Fortunately, she improved with this regimen and did not require surgery. The plan again was to discharge her with a long course of oral vancomycin with a taper, as per the infectious disease service's recommendation.

During the readmission, a pharmacist was consulted in order to help the patient gain access to oral vancomycin in advance of discharge. The pharmacist contacted the patient's insurance and was informed that the vancomycin oral solution could only be filled at a compounding pharmacy, and that the patient's usual retail pharmacy (part of a national chain) could not perform this service. Eventually, after much effort, an independent pharmacy was identified that could compound the medication and was contracted with the patient's insurance. Given the issues after her prior hospitalization, the patient remained hospitalized until a clear plan was in place to ensure her access to medication.

The independent pharmacy filled the oral vancomycin solution, which was delivered to the patient, and she was able to complete her treatment course. However, after the second discharge the inpatient pharmacist was contacted by the pharmacist at the patient's usual retail pharmacy. The outpatient pharmacist informed the inpatient pharmacist that a prescription for vancomycin oral capsules (not vancomycin solution) could have easily been filled after the initial discharge and would have been covered by the patient's insurance. Had this information been available, the patient might have been able to access the medication after the first discharge, potentially avoiding the patient's return of symptoms, the readmission, and the subsequent treatment costs.

================================================================================

Title: A "Reflexive" Diagnosis in Primary Care

The Case:
A 54-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented to a new primary care physician complaining of 2 years of progressive bilateral hand and foot paresthesias, pain, and weakness. Due to these symptoms, he had multiple falls and an inability to grasp simple objects. At the time, the primary care doctor documented 4/5 weakness in all extremities and a loss of sensation in his hands and feet bilaterally. Based on this, the patient was diagnosed with a peripheral neuropathy (a loss of sensation that typically begins in the hands and feet) and referred to see a neurologist sometime in the next 3 months.

Over the next 10 weeks, the patient returned 2 more times to the same clinic with worsening symptoms, including more frequent falls and new back pain. He saw two different providers who did not order any additional diagnostic testing and treated him supportively, assuming his symptoms were due to the previously diagnosed peripheral neuropathy.

When he was finally seen in the neurology clinic, the exam revealed hyperreflexia and increased tone in all extremities. This was most consistent with a spinal cord process and not a peripheral neuropathy. The neurologist ordered an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord, which revealed critical cervical (neck) cord compression, so tight that it placed the patient at risk for permanent paralysis. He was admitted to the hospital and underwent urgent neurosurgical decompression.

Unfortunately, likely due to the delay in making the diagnosis and surgery, the patient still has some weakness in his legs and persistent nerve pain.

A root cause analysis of the case revealed that none of the doctors who had seen the patient had performed an exam of the reflexes or assessed for overall muscle tone. The safety committee felt if these components of the exam had been performed, the providers may have arrived at the diagnosis earlier or may have made a more urgent referral to neurology.

================================================================================

Title: CYP450 Drugs: Expect the Unexpected

The Case:
A 42-year-old man with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (CD4 count 198), hip dystocia, and generalized anxiety disorder presented with acute sciatic pain. His human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) regimen (ritonavir-boosted darunavir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine) had been stable, resulting in an undetectable blood plasma viral load. In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, he was also taking clonazepam and escitalopram. After review by his primary care provider, the patient was referred to a spine orthopedist for management of his sciatica. A hip replacement had also been planned for his dystocia, but the sciatica resulted in a delay for his hip arthroplasty.

In response to his complaints, the spine surgeon elected to administer a single injection of epidural triamcinolone. However, one week after the injection, the patient returned to the surgeon's office complaining of fever, anxiety, nausea, abdominal pain, and insomnia. The surgeon advised the patient that these symptoms were not related to the epidural injection or the sciatic pain and referred the patient back to his internist. One week later, the patient was reexamined by the internist and found to have an elevated blood pressure (156/96 mm Hg), anxiety, 5-pound weight gain, and epigastric tenderness.Helicobacter pyloriscreening, HIV lab work, complete blood count, and chemistry screen revealed a decreased CD4 count to 98, nonfasting blood sugar of 166 mg/dL, and a positive urea breath test [a screening test forH. pylori]. One week of appropriateH. pyloritreatment resulted in no improvement in symptoms; in fact, the patient complained of increased insomnia, anxiety, sweats, and weight gain. The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome was considered, and subsequent testing for this syndrome was positive.

The physicians later recognized that HIV medications, particularly ritonavir-associated therapy, are associated with substantial numbers of drug–drug interactions. Ritonavir induces cytochrome P450 (CYP1A2); however, it inhibits the major P450 isoforms (3A4 and 2D6). It was determined that triamcinolone is a 3A4 substrate, and ritonavir has been implicated in Cushing syndrome following oral and other routes of synthetic corticosteroid administration. The spine surgeon had only noted that the patient "is on HIV medication and stable" and did not review each individual medication. In addition, the spine surgeon did not provide a consultation report to the internal medicine team and primary care provider regarding the steroid injection. Only after the medicine and HIV teams questioned the patient regarding recreational steroid use did the patient reveal his recent epidural therapy.

The patient experienced 4 weeks of Cushing-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, insomnia, impotence, anxiety, sweats, and nausea; symptoms improved after adjustment of his HIV medications. These post-epidural events delayed his hip replacement surgery by several months.

================================================================================

Title: Late Anemia Following Rh Disease in a Newborn

The Case:
A full-term neonate was delivered uneventfully to an Rh-negative woman who had received RhoGAM (Rho[D] immunoglobulin treatment) at 28 weeks. The neonate developed hyperbilirubinemia within 24 hours of delivery, which prompted initiation of aggressive phototherapy. He also received two blood transfusions and two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin in the neonatal intensive care unit. These therapies were given to prevent the need for a more risky exchange transfusion. On discharge at day-of-life (DOL) 10, hemoglobin and bilirubin levels were stable. The treatment plan was for regular blood draws to assess the ongoing stability of hemoglobin and bilirubin levels.

Over 3 visits in the subsequent 10 days, the patient was seen by different providers who all noted that the hemoglobin remained stable at 12 g/dL, and the bilirubin continued to fall. These reassuring trends were noted in the record. On DOL 25, the bilirubin maintained its downward trend, but the hemoglobin was also noted to have dropped to 10 g/dL. Given the bilirubin was decreasing, the providers were reassured and no additional lab draws were scheduled.

Two days later, the family brought the infant back to the urgent care clinic with unrelated concerns about redness around the umbilicus. Noting the reduction in hemoglobin from the last visit, a repeat hemoglobin test was ordered that came back even lower: 7.7 g/dL. The clinicians now recognized that the infant had active Rh hemolytic disease, and he was admitted to the hospital for blood transfusion and close monitoring. Due to the readmission and the family's frustration with the inconsistent care provided since the first discharge, the case was reviewed by the pediatric quality committee. While many communication concerns were identified, the key issue was the management of an uncommon disease using markers that are frequently trended for common conditions. The patient improved and he ultimately did well with appropriate therapies.

Title: After-Visit Confusion

The Case:
An otherwise healthy 18-year-old woman presented to an urgent care clinic with new bumps and white spots near her tongue. The patient's mother accompanied her and expressed concern that this could be "thrush"—based on her own understanding of that condition. The patient was examined and noted to have small white ulcerations at the base of her tongue and one on the left buccal mucosa. The symptoms developed a few days following an upper respiratory infection. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. The physician explained that this was likely herpetic gingivostomatitis and provided related information about the condition and its treatment plan. The patient was then discharged from the urgent care clinic and provided an after-visit summary that is generated from their electronic medical record (EMR). The written materials outline the diagnosis, care plans, and follow-up needs, all of which were reviewed by the medical assistant.

After returning home, the patient's mother continued searching her daughter's condition online, remained concerned about the possibility of thrush, and sent a couple of messages to the provider via a patient portal within the EMR. One particular issue was that the after-visit summary stated that the patient's diagnosis was thrush, despite the physician stating an alternate diagnosis. Ultimately, the physician spoke with the patient's mother, confirmed that his diagnosis of a herpetic viral infection was correct, apologized for the error on the after-visit summary, and reassured her that the condition was self-limited and would improve, which it did. Although no harm resulted from the interactions, the mistake on the after-visit summary and the communication discrepancies it generated led to a number of unnecessary phone calls and follow-up communications, not to mention understandable distress to the patient and her mother. The after-visit summary incorrectly populated the diagnosis of thrush from the triage information and it was not updated after the actual evaluation by either the physician or the medical assistant.

================================================================================

Title: Tough Call: Addressing Errors From Previous Providers

The Case:
A 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes on metformin presented to the emergency department (ED) with 3 days of progressive malaise, diffuse abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. On presentation, she was afebrile, tachycardic, and hypotensive, with normal oxygen saturation. Her laboratory data was notable for an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 23,000/mm3, acute kidney injury with an elevated creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (up from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL), and a severe metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic acidosis, with a pH = 7.05 with a lactate of 18 mmol/L (normal 0.5–1.6 mmol/L).

Based on her clinical presentation, she was treated for severe sepsis and given intravenous fluids and antibiotics. In reviewing her medical record, the admitting team noted she had been admitted 3 times in the last 2 months with the identical clinical presentation. Each time she had been diagnosed with sepsis even though no clear source of infection had been found, and each time she had improved and was discharged after 5 days in the hospital. In addition, during two of those hospitalizations, she required mechanical ventilation from pulmonary edema and volume overload from getting aggressive fluids to treat her "sepsis."

The admitting team re-examined all of the information and realized the clinical presentation was not consistent with sepsis; rather, it was far more consistent with acute lactic acidosis secondary to metformin (a well-recognized complication of metformin treatment). The metformin and antibiotics were stopped, and she was treated conservatively and did well. The metformin was added to her allergy list, and, since stopping, she had no further episodes.

The attending physician on the admitting team wondered why the diagnosis had not been made during the previous admissions. Although the degree of illness and lactic acidosis could be consistent with sepsis, no clear source of infection had been discovered; recurrent sepsis without a source is highly unlikely. In addition, the degree of lactic acidosis was out of proportion to the degree of illness, which should have prompted exploration for other causes of severe lactic acidosis (i.e., metformin). She felt like this was a diagnostic error—that the multiple clinicians and teams who had cared for the patient had likely "anchored" on the diagnosis of sepsis and didn't consider other possibilities. She wondered what to do. What was the most effective way to give feedback to the previous teams? Should the providers be blamed for possibly missing the diagnosis? Because the patient likely experienced harm because of the error, should anyone be punished? What could be done to prevent this from happening in the future?

================================================================================

Title: An Easily Forgotten Tube

The Case:
A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute liver failure secondary to alcohol abuse. His illness was complicated by acute renal failure requiring dialysis and by respiratory failure requiring intubation, as well as hepatic encephalopathy requiring therapy with lactulose. A rectal tube was inserted on hospital day 7 for management of diarrhea that occurred with lactulose therapy. Over the course of his ICU stay, the patient's encephalopathy improved and he was weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated.

On hospital day 9, he was transferred out of the ICU to a general medicine floor for continued care. His mental status improved and his serum ammonia decreased. Although lactulose was discontinued, the patient's diarrhea persisted. He passed a swallowing evaluation, made significant progress with physical and occupational therapy, and was recommended for eventual transfer to an acute rehabilitation facility. On hospital day 13, the patient was incidentally noted to have an internal jugular deep vein thrombosis, likely related to previous temporary dialysis catheter placement. An intravenous heparin infusion was started. On hospital day 14, the patient's hemoglobin dropped by 2 g/dL, and dark red liquid stool was noted in the rectal tube. The heparin infusion was stopped, and the patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells. On hospital day 15, the patient underwent colonoscopy, which revealed a large area of ulcerated mucosa comprising half the circumference of the rectum, likely caused by the rectal tube.

After discussion of the risks and benefits, the heparin infusion was discontinued. The patient did not require an increased level of care, but his inpatient stay was prolonged, and he received both transfusion and the colonoscopy because of the rectal ulcer.

================================================================================

Title: Nonsustained Ventricular Tachycardia After Acute Coronary Syndromes: Recognizing High-Risk Patients

The Case:
A 51-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension was admitted with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). After uncomplicated placement of two stents, she was transferred to the telemetry unit. About 12 hours after the procedure, the patient's nurse noted a five-beat run of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient was asymptomatic and other vital signs were stable. The nurse called the responsible physician who responded that "this was expected" (given her underlying heart disease and perhaps the possibility of reperfusion arrhythmias). The patient had several more short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). However, given the physician's initial response, the nurse did not notify the physician about these additional runs. About 2 hours after the initial run of VT, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest secondary to sustained VT. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions and defibrillation. Though the patient survived the initial arrest, she remained hypotensive and unfortunately did not regain any meaningful neurological function. Care was ultimately withdrawn 4 days after the event.

================================================================================

Title: Multifactorial Medication Mishap

The Case:
A previously healthy 50-year-old man was hospitalized while recovering from an uncomplicated spine surgery. Although he remained in moderate pain, clinicians planned to transition him from intravenous to oral opioids prior to discharge. The patient experienced nausea with pills but told the bedside nurse he had taken liquid opioids in the past without difficulty.

The nurse informed the physician that the patient was having significant pain, and liquid opioids had been effective in the past. When the physician searched for liquid oxycodone in the computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) system, multiple options appeared on the list—two formulations for tablets and two for liquid (the standard 5 mg per 5 mL concentration and a more concentrated 20 mg per mL formulation). At this hospital, the CPOE system listed each choice twice, one entry with the generic name and one entry with a brand name. In all, the physician saw eight different choices for oxycodone products. The physician chose the concentrated oxycodone liquid product, and ordered a 5-mg dose.

All medication orders at the hospital had to be verified by a pharmacist. The pharmacist reviewing this order recognized that the higher concentration was atypical for inpatients but assumed it was chosen to limit the volume of fluid given to the patient. The pharmacist verified the order and, to minimize the risk of error, added a comment to both the electronic medication administration record (eMAR) and the patient-specific label that the volume to be given was 0.25 mL (5 mg). For added safety, the pharmacist personally retrieved, labeled, and delivered the drug and a calibrated syringe to the bedside nurse to clarify that this was a high concentration formulation for which the volume to administer was 0.25 mL (a smaller volume than would typically be delivered).

Shortly thereafter, the nurse went to the bedside to administer the drug to the patient for his ongoing pain. She gave the patient 2.5 mL (50 mg) of liquid oxycodone, a volume that she was more used to giving, and then left for her break. A covering nurse checked on the patient and found him unconscious—a code blue was called. The patient was given naloxone (an agent that reverses the effect of opioids), and he responded well. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for ongoing monitoring and a continuous infusion of naloxone to block the effect of the oxycodone. By the following morning, the patient had returned to his baseline with no apparent adverse effects.

================================================================================

Title: Check the Anesthesia Machine

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with weight of 134 kg (body mass index [BMI] of 40) and history of hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea, claustrophobia, and 3-vessel coronary artery disease was scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Once in the operating room, the resident placed an arterial line in the patient's left arm under local anesthesia. Because the patient was unable to tolerate the facemask oxygen (due to claustrophobia), the attending anesthesiologist gave him the anesthetic circuit, which had oxygen flowing at 10 liters per minute and asked him to keep it in his mouth and breathe through it (like snorkeling) to achieve pre-oxygenation. The anesthesiologist then injected 2 mg of midazolam to sedate the patient.

After about 5 minutes, the anesthesia team noticed that the patient was unresponsive, with shallow breathing. Breathing was assisted with facemask ventilation and the airway was secured with endotracheal tube (after propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium rapid induction). Once anesthesia was induced, the anesthesiologist tried to turn on the anesthetic agent and noticed that the desflurane vaporizer was set to 12%. It was then discovered that the patient had inadvertently received 12% desflurane (a general anesthetic) instead of oxygen alone during pre-oxygenation. The logbook on the anesthesia machine showed that the machine had been checked that morning, but the resident had failed to notice the open desflurane vaporizer. The patient did not experience any obvious harm from the uncontrolled inhalation induction.

================================================================================

Title: SNFs: Opening the Black Box

The Case:
An 88-year-old woman was admitted to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after a lengthy hospitalization for a small bowel obstruction, acute renal failure, and deep vein thrombosis. On arrival to the SNF, the patient was on 14 medications for her various conditions and remained mildly delirious. Nursing staff at the SNF expressed concerns about the level of care that could be provided, but they were told that the patient "didn't meet inpatient criteria any longer." During the first few days of the SNF visit, the staff continued to express concerns about the patient's overall health because she was not able to take all of her medications. The family was also concerned. The SNF physician saw the patient on the first day but not after that time. He continued to manage questions via phone with the nursing staff. About 3 days after admission, the patient developed a fever and shortness of breath, prompting a 911 call and transfer back to the acute facility. There, she was diagnosed and treated for pneumonia.

================================================================================

Title: Finding Fault With the Default Alert

The Case:
A 33-year-old man with known refractory epilepsy and developmental delay was admitted to the hospital after experiencing increased seizures. He previously had been well managed with levetiracetam (Keppra); however, therapy had been discontinued after the patient experienced a new rash. Once admitted to the hospital, his seizures were controlled with fosphenytoin. Discharged 2 days later, the outpatient plan was to begin phenytoin 500 mg once daily. However, the discharge prescription was erroneously written as phenytoin 500 mg "three times daily" (TID). His outpatient pharmacy filled this prescription and the patient subsequently took the medication at this frequency for 2 days. After noting the patient's difficulty in walking, his mother contacted the primary team, the error was identified, and the frequency of dosing corrected to "once daily."

In review of the resident's discharge note, the discharge plan for the phenytoin was clearly stated, i.e., "once daily." However the resident was relatively unfamiliar with the electronic medical record (EMR) and failed to notice that the EMR default frequency for phenytoin was "TID." While the error may be attributed to a "slip" by a busy resident who was unfamiliar with the computer ordering system, alert fatigue also played a role. When a phenytoin dose much greater than normal is prescribed, the EMR triggers an alert for the clinician; this alert was overridden by the resident. Furthermore, it is likely that the hospital pharmacy similarly missed or overrode a dosing alert. Lastly, the community pharmacy did not question the 500 mg TID dosing regimen. Although the patient was inadvertently prescribed excessive phenytoin and experienced temporary toxicity, he experienced only temporary harm. As a result of this error, the hospital changed its default setting for phenytoin from TID to once daily.

================================================================================

Title: Are You Mrs. A? An Issue of Identification Over Telephone

The Case:
Mr. A was a 78-year-old man admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with acute kidney injury for whom medical management was chosen due to his multiple comorbidities. The patient's code status was DNR (do not resuscitate). Mr. B was a 62-year-old man admitted to the same medicine unit with hypoglycemia and a diabetic foot ulcer. He had a past medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. At 1:00 AM, the nurse found Mr. A unresponsive. The medicine intern was notified and pronounced Mr. A dead.

The intern went to the counter of the floor's central nursing unit to complete the death certificate and to notify the next-of-kin. The unit clerk usually put the death certificate folder on the counter next to the deceased patient's chart. This time, the chart next to the death certificate was Mr. B's chart. The intern grabbed Mr. B's chart, mistakenly believing that this was Mr. A's chart, and looked at the contact information on the front sheet. He called the number and notified Mrs. B that her husband had died. After erroneously notifying Mrs. B, he shifted his focus to completing the death certificate. It was at that point that he discovered that he had the wrong chart. He called Mrs. B back immediately, about 20 minutes after the previous call. Unfortunately, Mrs. B had called her children and let them know that their father had died. The intern apologized to Mrs. B and let her speak to her husband to reassure her. He then called Mrs. A and notified her about the death of her husband.

After being notified of the error, Mrs. B and her children were distraught after experiencing 20 minutes of thinking that their beloved husband/father had died.

================================================================================

Title: It's Sarah, Not Stephen!

The Case:
An 8-year-old child, born male who identified as and expressed externally (e.g., clothing, haircut, behavior) as a girl, presented for a new patient appointment. The patient's mother, aware that her child's preferred name was not consistent with her legal name and sex, had alerted the clinic of the child's preferred name at the time of making the appointment. When the patient and her mother arrived for the clinic visit, the medical staff was unaware of the registration documentation regarding the patient's preferred name and called for the patient in the waiting room using her legal (masculine) name.

The mother and child felt embarrassed and humiliated by this course of events. Both were visibly upset and the provider had to spend additional time during the clinical visit addressing the emotional impact of inappropriately calling this patient a masculine name. The clinic staff had received prior training in addressing transgender and gender-variant people by their preferred names but had not developed communication processes to best convey this information.

The clinician acknowledged the error when it occurred, apologized for the harm done, and reassured both mother and child that it was not the intention of the clinic to have the child feel her identity was questioned or undermined. The provider suggested that the parent contact the ombudsperson's office directly to comment specifically on what was done well at that visit and what specific behaviors could be improved in the future care of her child. The patient's mother did just that.

================================================================================

Title: A Picture Speaks 1000 Words

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type A aortic dissection repair presented with chest pain at a community hospital. An aortic protocol computed tomography (CT) for dissection was ordered and performed, and the preliminary reading from the on-call resident was "no acute changes." Since the dissection was believed to be stable and a higher level of care appeared unnecessary, the patient was admitted to the medicine service of the hospital for further workup.

Six hours after the patient arrived to the medical floor, he developed increasing migratory chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. The medical team arrived to find him hypotensive, tachycardic, and minimally responsive, with unequal blood pressures in his arms. Despite intensive care unit transfer and aggressive life-saving interventions, he died a few hours later. Autopsy revealed proximal progression of the false lumen of his known type A dissection with rupture into the pericardial sac.

The case was reviewed in light of the tragic outcome. The hospital that cared for the patient was a federal facility affiliated with a large academic medical center. This facility had no in-house radiology services at night; thus, nighttime studies were sent electronically to on-call residents at the academic medical center. A data firewall had been constructed to "improve information security" at the federal facility, which rendered the radiology residents unable to access previous studies, only the text reports of the studies. The barrier, which had initially blocked both text reports and actual radiology studies, was well known to the on-call radiology residents, and they had developed a workaround to allow them to access the text reports. In this particular case, the overnight read by the resident was based on a comparison of the current study with the results on the text report of the prior dissection. The following morning, an attending radiologist determined that a comparison of the new study and the prior images clearly demonstrated proximal progression of the dissection.

Following this case, data safety and monitoring policies were changed. Access to stored imaging was facilitated and the firewall was disabled. Informal enquiries with other federal institutions suggest that employment of such firewalls and security protocols is commonplace.

================================================================================

Title: DRESSed for Failure

The Case:
A 60-year-old woman who uses a wheelchair presented to the emergency department (ED) with right hand cellulitis and an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. The patient had a complicated medical history that included poly-substance abuse, hepatitis C, a mitral valve replacement, and multiple strokes, which left her non-verbal and fully dependent on caretakers for tasks of daily living. In the ED, she was treated with a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone and sent home with a prescription for oral cephalexin. One week later, the patient returned to the ED critically ill with hypotension, altered mental status, and an erythematous rash on her upper extremities. She was admitted to the intensive care and treated presumptively for sepsis. Dermatology was consulted to evaluate her desquamating rash and, on full chart review, they noted a previous diagnosis of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) associated with cephalexin. High-dose steroids were administered and the patient's condition rapidly improved. She ultimately returned to her baseline condition and was discharged home with her caretaker.

In conducting a root cause analysis of the error, the patient's history of cephalexin-induced DRESS was only documented as an "allergy" in the previous electronic health record (EHR). The medical center recently transitioned to a new EHR, and the institution made a deliberate decision to have clinicians review all patient allergies "from scratch" rather than simply transfer the information over from the old system. However, despite a few ambulatory visits for this patient since transition to the new EHR, the allergy list was never updated to include cephalexin. Further complicating this particular case, because the affected patient was non-verbal with many caretakers over the past few years, history taking was unreliable.

================================================================================

Title: Anesthesia: A Weighty Issue

The Case:
A 77-year-old woman was evaluated preoperatively in anticipation of an elective left hip arthroplasty. She reported having a history of hypertension that was reasonably well controlled on procardia, atenolol, and lisinopril. The patient reported no history of bleeding disorders, tobacco use, anesthetic complications, or other significant comorbidities. Her calculated body mass index was 34. She was medically cleared for surgery.

The following week, the patient underwent an uneventful left hip arthroplasty with general anesthesia via a laryngeal mask airway. She had stable vital signs throughout. She was breathing spontaneously following the procedure and was safely extubated and transferred to the recovery unit. The patient continued to receive doses of morphine sulfate for procedure-related pain, which became complicated by increasing somnolence. She was also noted to have oxygen desaturations and, as these persisted, an arterial blood gas was drawn that demonstrated an acidosis with a markedly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 81 mm Hg. Attempts at noninvasive ventilation failed and the patient was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. After better pain control and airway assessment, the patient was extubated the following day and had an uneventful hospital course to discharge. Providers suggested in the discharge summary that the patient likely had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and would benefit from formal outpatient testing. Given the reintubation in the recovery unit, the case was reviewed by the hospital quality committee and questions were raised whether obese patients undergoing anesthesia should receive formal preoperative screening for OSA.

================================================================================

Title: Discharge Instructions in the PACU: Who Remembers?

The Case:
A 42-year-old woman was diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her left knee after a skiing accident. Before arthroscopic surgery, she had been given postoperative instructions for ACL repair, which included 50% weight bearing starting immediately. Upon examination of the knee under anesthesia and with visualization from the arthroscope, the surgeon determined that the ACL was only partially torn and that the joint had sufficient stability. Rather than ACL repair, the surgeon performed microfracture to address damage to the intraarticular cartilage as well as meniscus repair.

After the surgery, the surgeon briefed the patient in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) on his findings and the revised postoperative instructions. Because of the microfracture procedure, she was to be completely non-weight bearing for 6 weeks—a significant change from what had been originally anticipated. However, the patient was still groggy from the anesthesia and asked the doctor to give this information to her husband. The doctor called the number in the chart and made contact with the patient's mother-in-law who understood the surgeon to say that a second surgery would be required (rather than that a different type of surgery had been performed) and the patient should abide by the postoperative instructions he had given her. It was not understood by the mother-in-law that these instructions had in fact changed.

None of this was in writing. When the husband picked up the patient, the written discharge instructions from the surgeon were generic and personalized only with the handwritten phrase "do as instructed." Confused, the patient followed the original, now incorrect, postoperative instructions. The confusion was never discovered at two subsequent postop visits, in part because the surgeon never explained specifically how the rehabilitation guidelines had changed based on the new findings and change in plan during surgery. The patient pushed herself to bear weight several weeks after the surgery. When she experienced significant pain, she called the surgeon who then chastised her for not following the postoperative plan. Needless to say, the patient was upset and concerned that she may have harmed her chances for a full recovery.

================================================================================

Title: Emergency Error

The Case:
An 81-year-old woman with a history of pancreatitis presented with the acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On presentation, she was in distress due to severe abdominal pain. She was hypotensive and tachycardic. Based on the exam and initial imaging, there was concern for small bowel obstruction.

The decision was made to take the patient to emergency laparotomy. At the time of induction, she was given fentanyl, etomidate, and rocuronium. Almost immediately, her blood pressure dropped to 60/30 mm Hg. She was rapidly intubated, but her hypotension persisted despite epinephrine. Her heart rate slowed, and she ultimately developed asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. She received advanced cardiac life support for 10 minutes. She ultimately regained a pulse but required high doses of vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure. The operation was cancelled and she was taken to the intensive care unit. Over the next 12 hours she had progressive multi-organ system failure, and she died the following morning.

The hospital's case review committee felt the patient likely had severe acute pancreatitis and not a small bowel obstruction. The committee's judgment was that this represented a diagnostic error and that this was a preventable death (because surgery would not have been indicated in the management of her pancreatitis). The case raised many questions about the safety of and errors associated with emergency surgery.

================================================================================

Title: Don't Use That Port: Insert a PICC

The Case:
A 48-year-old woman receiving neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer was admitted to the hospital with fever and abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan in the emergency department revealed acute appendicitis and surgery was recommended. Although the patient had a chest port in place, the surgeon refused to access the port, and instead requested placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The surgeon believed that the port device should be exclusively used for chemotherapy, not to provide venous access for other purposes; he felt strongly that such use would increase the risk of infection. Although the vascular access nurse disagreed and advised that the port should be used for vascular access during surgery, the surgeon ordered PICC insertion by interventional radiology. The patient underwent a complicated PICC placement requiring multiple insertion attempts and adjustments. The next day, she developed severe arm pain and swelling and was found to have an acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) involving the axillary and subclavian veins on the side of the PICC. Surgery was canceled, and she was placed on anticoagulation therapy and managed conservatively for appendicitis. The patient ultimately recovered but only after significant complications including contained perforation, peritonitis, and prolonged hospitalization (in addition to the blood clots).

================================================================================

Title: Polypharmacy

The Case:
A 65-year-old man with schizophrenia receives his routine outpatient psychiatric care through an agency. His case manager visits him weekly regarding medication adherence, which includes biweekly visits to his clinic for administration of his risperidone depot injection. He receives all his oral medications dispensed in weekly blister packs from his local pharmacy; however, the risperidone is provided by a separate "specialty pharmacy" that dispenses all long-acting injectable antipsychotics for the agency.

At his usual visit to his local pharmacy to obtain his oral medications, his pharmacist dispensed not only the usual oral medications but also the risperidone depot injection kit. The patient accepted the risperidone without disclosing this fact to his caregiver or case manager. On return to home, he reconstituted the powdered medication and self-administered the risperidone into his gluteus. Two days later, when contacted with a reminder regarding his upcoming injection (at the clinic), he reported his self-administration of the risperidone. The pharmacist at his local pharmacy was contacted and verified that the risperidone had been dispensed directly to the patient, even though it had never been previously filled by this pharmacy. This was a near miss, in that the patient did not receive the duplicate injection. The local pharmacy was advised to not dispense the injectable medication to the patient in the future.

================================================================================

Title: Acute Care Admission of the Behavioral Health Patient

The Case:
A 25-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 3-week history of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and weakness. His medical history included Crohn disease with ileocolectomy and ileostomy; chronic pain; schizophrenia and major depression with prior suicide attempts; and narcotic abuse with hydrocodone. Medications included mesalamine, clonidine, tramadol, haloperidol, olanzapine, venlafaxine, potassium chloride, and magnesium oxide. The patient was disabled, participated in an intensive case management program (ICM), and lived in supportive housing.

The ED work-up was consistent with acute pancreatitis and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A gastroenterology (GI) consult noted that olanzapine can cause pancreatitis. In addition, the GI consult described how the patient requested a reduction in the haloperidol dose because he felt overmedicated. The GI consult declined the patient's request and suggested that changes in the haloperidol dose, as well as the decision to discontinue olanzapine, should be made by the patient's psychiatrist.

Despite this advice, the medical team discontinued the olanzapine without consulting the patient's psychiatrist. The patient's condition improved and he was discharged to home. The discharge summary documented that the patient was instructed to follow up with his primary care provider, his gastroenterologist, and his psychiatrist in 1 week, and to inform his psychiatrist that olanzapine had been discontinued. Tragically, 2 weeks after discharge the patient committed suicide.

================================================================================

Title: From Possible to Probable to Sure to Wrong—Premature Closure and Anchoring in a Complicated Case

The Case:
A previously healthy 44-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a 2-day history of headache and word-finding difficulties. Neurological examination was normal but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed parietal and frontal masses concerning for malignancy or infection. Biopsy revealed evidence of vasculitis. Consultation with infectious disease, rheumatology, and neurology led to a provisional diagnosis of primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. The patient was started on steroid and cyclophosphamide therapy and discharged after improvement in his symptoms.

Over the next month, the patient continued to feel well without a recurrence of his symptoms; however, serial brain MRI showed progression of the patient's lesions. Given his symptomatic improvement, the steroids were slowly tapered. A repeat MRI continued to show progression. Four months after the initial presentation, he re-presented to the emergency department after developing receptive and expressive aphasia and disorientation. Imaging again revealed evidence of worsening lesions and repeat biopsy showed glioblastoma multiforme. The patient underwent resection and adjuvant chemotherapy followed by rapid clinical decline.

Subsequent review of the case, including the clinical documentation, noted that the provisional diagnosis of CNS vasculitis at the time of hospital discharge gradually morphed into a certain diagnosis of CNS vasculitis during the ensuing outpatient follow-up, in both the minds of the clinicians and the chart documentation. As a result, the diagnosis was not revisited, even in the presence of contradictory data, leading to prolonged inappropriate therapy and a delay in the correct diagnosis and treatment.

================================================================================

Title: Pathologic Mistake

The Case:
A 32-year-old previously healthy woman experienced abdominal pain and bloating for 6 months. The discomfort worsened with eating. After losing 15 pounds in less than 2 months, she visited her primary care physician. Initial imaging showed enlarged abdominal lymph nodes as well as jejunal thickening and dilated ileum in the small bowel. A lymph node biopsy and partial small bowel resection was undertaken. Lymph node pathology was reported as "Castleman disease, of hyaline vascular type," while the small bowel biopsy was normal.

Castleman is a rare disease in which immune cells in the lymph nodes proliferate. It is not considered a cancer, but is treated by physicians who specialize in lymphomas. With this diagnosis, her primary physician appropriately referred her to the lymphoma clinic. Physical exam, laboratory tests, and repeat computed tomography (CT) scans were all consistent with the initial workup, and the specialist began making plans to administer chemotherapy for Castleman. Still, the lymphoma specialist was struck by a number of inconsistencies. The combination of the location and number of affected lymph nodes would have made this an extremely rare presentation of an already rare disease. Also, CT findings of jejunal thickening and a dilated ileum were atypical for this diagnosis.

Puzzled, the lymphoma specialist requested a second pathology opinion from a tertiary care center with expertise in Castleman disease. The review reported reactive lymph nodes with hyalinization but no other features of Castleman, and normal small bowel. Plans for chemotherapy were cancelled. Lacking a diagnosis, further work-up was initiated. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and blood work was consistent with adult-onset celiac disease. She was started on a gluten-free diet. Follow-up imaging at 4 months showed dramatic improvement, and with strict adherence to her diet, the patient is still symptom-free.

================================================================================

Title: The Unfamiliar Catheter

The Case:
A 28-year-old woman, 20 months post–bilateral lung transplant, presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and was admitted to the hospital. Diagnostic studies revealed that she was producing donor-specific antibodies. A large bore central line, similar to a hemodialysis catheter, was placed in her right chest, and daily bedside plasmapheresis therapy was initiated as treatment for humeral rejection.

A registered nurse (RN) received orders to draw the patient's morning labs. Although she had worked with many other types of catheters, the RN asked the charge nurse for instructions because she had no previous experience with this type of catheter. The charge nurse provided the RN with the following basic verbal instructions: waste 3 cc, draw labs, flush with saline, HEP-LOCK. The RN felt confident that the verbal instructions were sufficient.

The patient was awake and in no apparent distress when the RN entered her room. The two chatted as the RN drew the patient's labs. After all the tubes had been filled the patient sat upright and said, "Something isn't right." As the RN reached around the bedside table to grab the saline flush, the patient began to convulse. The RN called for help as the patient lost consciousness and fell, bleeding from her catheter, to the floor. The patient spent the next 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). She was conscious yet unable to respond for the first 24 hours. Testing revealed a cerebral air embolism, and the medical opinion was that damage was likely to be temporary.

The nurse manager conducted an immediate and thorough incident review, which revealed that the RN had failed to clamp the catheter prior to removing the syringe, thus allowing air to enter the catheter and obstruct the patient's circulatory system. The devastated RN requested a temporary leave of absence, but never returned to work. The hospital enacted a policy allowing only trained RNs to access the catheters and requiring all RNs to receive mandatory education.

================================================================================

Title: A Weighty Mistake

The Case:
A 17-month-old toddler was brought to the emergency department (ED) by her parents with concerns about an infection around the eye. A triage nurse took the patient's vital signs, including her weight, and escorted her and the parents to a room for evaluation. The resident and attending physician diagnosed an uncomplicated periorbital cellulitis and prescribed clindamycin 225 mg orally three times daily based on the patient's weight. The patient received the first dose in the ED and was then discharged home.

The following evening, the patient's mother called the ED to report that the patient's discharge paperwork listed a weight of 25 kg rather than her true weight of 25 lb (11.3 kg). The mother, a medical student, realized the potential implications of such an error and asked the resident on duty to recalculate the appropriate dosage. The patient's dose was changed to 113 mg three times daily, and the patient continued the course with resolution of the cellulitis. Other than mild and self-limited diarrhea, there were no significant adverse effects from the four larger doses administered prior to the dose change. On further investigation, the initial triage nurse incorrectly entered the patient's weight (25 pounds) as a weight in kilograms in the electronic medical record (EMR), an error that was not caught by other providers throughout the ED visit.

================================================================================

Title: CVC Placement: Speak Now or Do Not Use the Line

The Case:
A 48-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, psychiatric illness, and a previous suicide attempt overdosed on her blood pressure medication (calcium channel blocker). When found unresponsive by her partner on the bathroom floor, she was brought by ambulance to the emergency department (ED). A right subclavian central line was placed during resuscitation.

No blood return was obtained from any of the lines. The ED team thought this was likely due to severe hypotension (her systolic blood pressure was around 50 mm Hg), but there was some concern that the line was not in the proper position. A chest radiograph was obtained when the patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU). The initial reading noted that the line might have been in the right atrium (which is to say, inserted too far). However, the radiology attending physician concluded the line was in good position.

Reassured, the line was used by the cardiology team to deliver medications and fluids during pacemaker insertion. Several hours later, a repeat chest radiograph was ordered after the patient began to vomit. This radiograph showed whiteout of the right lung, and ultimately the clinicians realized that the tip of the subclavian line was actually within the lung. Approximately 1400 cc of fluid was then removed from her pleural space via thoracentesis. Fortunately, the patient made a full recovery.

================================================================================

Title: Death by PCA

The Case:
A healthy 21-year-old pregnant woman delivered a healthy baby via Caesarean section after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Two hours after delivery, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurse removed the patient's epidural catheter (placed prior to Caesarean section) and implemented an order for a morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with a 2-mg bolus, 6-minute lockout, and a 4-hour limit of 30 mg. Two concentrations of morphine are normally available for PCA use, 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL. The nurse used a 5 mg/mL morphine cassette because a 1 mg/mL cassette was not available. Upon admission to the ward 3 hours after delivery, the ward nurse reviewed the history settings on the PCA pump and confirmed the pump settings were consistent with the order. However, she did not read the label on the cassette, open the pump, or assess the volume being infused.

Four hours after delivery, the patient complained of itching after breastfeeding her infant. The nurse administered 25 mg Benadryl intravenously followed by a second 25-mg dose of Benadryl 45 minutes later. Six hours after delivery the patient was alert, oriented, and awake. Later in the evening the patient was found asleep and snoring. Her vitals were within normal range and the nurse noted that 20 mg of morphine had been infused. Thirty minutes later the patient had no detectable pulse or respirations. Despite resuscitation efforts, she was pronounced dead 7.5 hours after initiation of the PCA.

Autopsy revealed a toxic concentration of morphine. The available evidence is consistent with a concentration programming error where morphine 1 mg/mL was entered in the infusion pump instead of 5 mg/mL.

================================================================================

Title: Delay in Treatment: Failure to Contact Patient Leads to Significant Complications

The Case:
A 21-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with heavy vaginal bleeding. She was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) service for management. She received a blood transfusion and a Depo-Provera injection (a hormone to stop the bleeding), and was discharged home the next day. As part of the evaluation for her vaginal bleeding, a chlamydia test was performed in the ED. This test returned positive the day after the patient was discharged.

Per a standard protocol, the positive laboratory result was sent through the electronic medical record (EMR) to a nurse who worked in the OB/GYN clinic. She followed standard procedure and tried to call the patient using the contact number in the EMR. No one answered, and the nurse called again on each of the next 4 days, but there continued to be no answer. She notified her clinic supervisor who noted the result, but made no further attempts to contact the patient.

One week later, the patient presented to the radiology department for an ultrasound that had been scheduled at the time of the initial hospitalization. The ultrasound technician did not notice the abnormal test result or the fact that the chlamydia infection had not been treated. The following day, a different OB/GYN clinic nurse tried to call the patient with the ultrasound results, and again no one answered the phone. She sent a letter by mail to the patient with both the ultrasound and chlamydia results. The patient received the letter and came to clinic 2 weeks later (now 26 days after her initial presentation) where she received appropriate antibiotics for the chlamydia infection (a single dose of azithromycin).

Despite this treatment, she developed fevers and abdominal pain and presented to the ED. She was diagnosed with chlamydial pyosalpinx (infection of the fallopian tubes) and peritonitis. This severe form of chlamydial infection likely developed because of the delay in treatment. The patient needed to be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged 3 days later and was expected to make a full recovery, although there is some risk of long-term complications including infertility and chronic pelvic pain.

================================================================================

Title: Preventing PICC Complications: Whose Line Is It?

The Case:
A 55-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department with 1 week of progressive left arm swelling, neck pain, and fevers. For the past year, the patient was receiving treatment for myasthenia gravis with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). On admission, she was found to have extensive catheter-related thrombosis in the subclavian, axillary, and internal jugular veins. Her blood cultures subsequently grewstaphylococcus aureusand she was diagnosed with endocarditis and osteomyelitis of her cervical spine. Her hospital course was complicated by sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure. The patient ultimately died during the hospitalization.

The hospital's quality committee reviewed the case. They noted that the patient had a PICC line placed at one facility but was receiving IVIG infusions at a different hospital closer to home. Questions were raised about who had responsibility for the line, whether it should have been replaced periodically to reduce infection risk, and what other strategies might have prevented this outcome.

================================================================================

Title: A Real Heartache

The Case:
A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with 2 hours of burning chest pain. The pain began at rest, and it radiated to his back and left axilla. He had no other complaints and reported being in good health otherwise. His past medical history was notable for a history of depression, a 40-pack/year history of cigarette smoking, and a father who had a heart attack at age 49. On physical examination, his initial blood pressure was elevated at 192/100 mm Hg, but his heart rate and the rest of his cardiopulmonary examination were normal. Bilateral upper-extremity blood pressures were equal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained (Figure 1) and interpreted as unremarkable. A chest radiograph and routine blood work, including a troponin assay, were also normal. The patient received aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin without symptom improvement. Subsequently, a "GI cocktail" (an oral antacid/anesthetic combination) was given, and the patient reported symptom relief; his blood pressure also normalized. Convinced that a cardiac etiology had been ruled out because of the atypical pain, the unremarkable ECG, the normal troponin, and the response to the GI cocktail, the ED physician discharged the patient to home with a presumptive diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician.

Two days later, the patient made an unscheduled return visit to the ED, now in severe distress. He complained of abdominal pain and was dyspneic, hypotensive, and with mottled skin. Fluid and pressor support was initiated, and the patient was intubated. ED physicians obtained an ECG (Figure 2), which showed ST-segment elevation, prompting urgent cardiology consultation with concern for an acute myocardial infarction and/or aortic dissection. A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion, and the patient was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization lab. Cardiac catheterization showed branch occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery. The patient stabilized and further evaluation did not reveal a myocardial rupture. Two days later, the patient had a cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated. An autopsy revealed 3-vessel atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and a 4-day-old transmural myocardial infarct with extension and associated rupture of the left ventricular free wall. The consensus of the ED quality committee's case review was that the patient had a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, which was missed at his initial presentation.

================================================================================

Title: Electrocardiogram Results: ***READ ME***

The Case:
A 63-year-old woman with labile hypertension presented to the emergency department (ED) with new onset chest discomfort and an initial blood pressure of 210/100 mm/Hg. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was unchanged from previous studies and her symptoms resolved with treatment of the hypertension. She was admitted overnight with orders for a morning ECG and serial troponin (ST) levels, the first of which was normal. At 6:00 AM, a nursing assistant obtained the ordered ECG and placed it in the patient's bedside chart without notifying a nurse or physician.

When the team was rounding 2 hours later, they reviewed the ECG, which was notable for new ST elevations inferiorly and laterally. The computer readout of the ECG stated, "****ACUTE MI****" and cited the ST elevations. On questioning the patient, she did report intermittent chest pressure overnight that was less severe than it was when she presented. Her morning troponin level also returned elevated, which was consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). After urgent evaluation, she underwent successful coronary angiography and placement of two stents. She was discharged home without complications and on appropriate medical therapy.

The case raised concerns about the review of ECGs routinely performed in the hospital setting and often by those without the skills to interpret them. In this case, the nursing assistant later reported that she wasn't sure that "MI" meant "heart attack," but she also said that she doesn't routinely look at the computer interpretations. It was unclear whether the delay of 2 hours influenced the patient's outcome, but it could have.

================================================================================

Title: Missed Pneumonia

The Case:
A 32-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with 3 days of fever and right pleuritic chest pain. Review of systems was negative for cough or dyspnea, and medical, surgical, and social history were unremarkable. The patient had taken a 2-hour plane ride the day before onset of symptoms.

On arrival to the ED, the patient was tachycardic at 106 beats per minute, tachypneic at 24 breaths per minute, and febrile to 38.8° C orally. No heart or lung abnormalities were noted on exam. Initial workup included a normal complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP), an elevated D-dimer (666 μg/mL), and a moderate right pleural effusion on chest radiograph. Although the clinicians had a high suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) chest demonstrated moderate right pleural effusion without evidence of PE or infiltrate. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for oxycodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Discharge diagnoses were "fever, pleural effusion, and chest wall pain."

The patient returned to the ED 3 days later reporting worsening pain and continued fever with new cough and dyspnea. Examination was significant for tachycardia at 105 beats per minute, mild tachypnea at 20 breaths per minute, and diminished right-sided lung sounds. Laboratory test results, including CBC and BMP, were unremarkable. However, a chest radiograph now showed a right-sided effusion with consolidative changes, and a thoracentesis was consistent with parapneumonic effusion. The patient was started on antibiotics and admitted for pneumonia with effusion. The patient quickly improved on antibiotics and was discharged 2 days later.

================================================================================

Title: Buprenorphine and the Medically Ill Patient

The Case:
A 60-year-old man with a 15-year history of oxycodone dependence presented to a substance abuse detoxification program with acute withdrawal symptoms, including dilated pupils, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hot and cold flashes. He reported his last opiate intake was 2 days earlier. He felt his addiction was out of control and he wanted treatment.

His medical history was notable for hypertension and a 30-year history of tobacco use (2 packs per day). He went to a local emergency department (ED) a month ago for a cough. No outside medical or prescription records were obtained prior to initiating treatment. On physical examination, abnormal findings included dilated pupils, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, hyperactive bowel sounds, and scattered wheezes and rhonchi bilaterally.

Per the treatment program's protocol, the patient received buprenorphine/naloxone (4.0 mg/1.0 mg) for opiate detoxification, first at 2:00 PM and then again at 4:00 PM. When the nurse checked on the patient at 7:00 PM, he was difficult to arouse and cyanotic with notable respiratory muscle retractions, a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 67%.

The patient was transported to the nearest ED where he was diagnosed with acute opiate-induced respiratory distress complicated by pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The ED staff obtained outside medical and pharmacy records, which indicated the patient was hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at another hospital 3 weeks prior and was given a prescription for oral antibiotics and other medications, which he never picked up from his pharmacy. Fortunately, the patient made a full recovery after 4 days on the medicine ward and was then discharged back to the substance abuse unit.

================================================================================

Title: Looking for Meds in All the Wrong Places

The Case:
A 40-year-old uninsured woman with anxiety ran out of her prescribed clonazepam and had a seizure. She went to the emergency department (ED) where she was given the prescription, but before the patient was discharged she had another seizure. The ED doctor saw the patient and made plans to discharge her after she received an intravenous (IV) administration of phenytoin (another antiseizure medication), assuming she was doing well and had stable vital signs.

The order was written correctly in the electronic medical record (EMR) for phenytoin, 800 mg IV. The drug-dispensing machines stocked phenytoin in 250 mg/1 mL vials. The correct dose therefore would require 4 vials and be equal to 3.2 mL to be added to a small IV bag. The nurse misread the order as 8000 mg (8 g) and proceeded to administer that dose to the patient, which was a 10-fold overdose and 2 to 3 times the lethal dose. The patient died several minutes after the infusion.

The error was noted during the code blue. The nurses responding to the code noticed the dozens of vials and the IV bag, which had a notation indicating the medication and the dose. An audit of the pharmacy system revealed that the nurse had taken 32 vials out of 3 different pharmacy dispensing machines to accumulate 8 g of IV phenytoin. Moreover, the nurse had to use two IV bags and a piggyback line to give that large a dose. Within 100 feet of the ED nurses' station were several ED doctors, a number of nurses, and a pharmacy with a PhD pharmacist on duty. The nurse did not ask anyone to check her calculations, nor did anyone notice or comment when she was moving around the unit amassing the vials needed for the dose.

================================================================================

Title: CA-MRSA Skin Infections: An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure

The Case:
A 16-year-old adolescent boy was a member of his junior varsity wrestling team. One morning during wrestling season, he noticed a sore spot on his left buttock, assumed it was an insect bite, and applied hydrocortisone cream. Two days later, he noticed the bump was larger with a small amount of pus at the center. Assuming it was an ingrown hair, he expressed the pus. He attended school and practice the next day and did not mention the bump to his parents, teachers, or coach. It was his turn for "mat duty" after practice, and he used the same mop that was used every day to wipe down the mats. As the week progressed, he noticed the bump was increasingly tender and painful to sit on. After several days, the lesion had grown larger and was now red, raised, and warm, and he notified his mother.

His mother took him to the pediatrician that day. His vital signs were within normal range and he rated his pain 6/10. His pediatrician, who had seen him regularly since birth, noted that his immunizations were up to date and he had no chronic illnesses or prior hospitalizations. He had a history of a Septra allergy (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), with a rash associated with past treatment of otitis media. The pediatrician ruled out brown recluse spider bite due to geography, and his wrestling made the pediatrician suspicious of community-acquired methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(CA-MRSA) skin infection. The pediatrician incised the lesion, expressed pus, and cultured the fluid. Considering his Septra allergy, the pediatrician prescribed oral clindamycin 450 mg every 6 hours for 10 days, with follow-up in 7 days, and ibuprofen for pain.

Four days after starting antibiotics, the patient complained of hip pain with ambulation and he assumed he had pulled something during wrestling practice. He was observed to be pale and complained of chills and hip pain. His temperature was 102° F. His mother noted the lesion was larger and his whole buttock was red and swollen with red streaks. She immediately took her son to the emergency department (ED).

Deep tissue debridement of the hip lesion was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) because the patient was not stable enough to have it performed in the operating room. Despite the debridement and appropriate antibiotics, by hospital day 3, he developed acute renal failure necessitating peritoneal dialysis and respiratory failure requiring intubation. Results from the original wound culture revealed CA-MRSA resistant to clindamycin. A radiograph showed extensive erosion at the femur head secondary to osteomyelitis.

The patient had a prolonged and stormy hospital course. On ICU day 20 he was extubated and moved to the step-down unit. As a result of the femur head destruction, he required a left total hip replacement. He continued physical therapy at home and was referred to a psychologist for long-term management of the issues surrounding his disability. It is expected that he will require hip replacements every 10 to 30 years for the rest of his life.

================================================================================

Title: Undetected Foreign Object

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis), hypertension, and diabetes was found to have obstructive, multi-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient was referred for bypass surgery and mitral valve repair. He underwent successful surgery and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility where he recuperated at the expected rate.

The patient continued to attend hemodialysis and clinic visits without fail. Eight months later, he was admitted to the hospital with shaking chills and confusion and found to have an empyema (i.e., collection of pus) on the left side of his chest. He underwent thoracic surgery where the trapped lung was freed from its adhesions and a 12-cm red-rubber snare was recovered—a surgical instrument from the prior surgery. The patient recovered to his baseline level of functioning after a 10-day intensive care unit (ICU) course followed by treatment in a rehabilitation facility.

On subsequent investigation, hospital staff members were puzzled by the failure to detect the object. The patient underwent three-times weekly dialysis sessions, at least eight clinic visits with multiple physicians, and had no symptoms until his dramatic presentation many months later. He also had seven chest radiographs postoperatively in which the device was not detected.

================================================================================

Title: Empty Handoff

The Case:
A 29-year-old man with "brittle diabetes" was admitted to the surgery service for incision and drainage of a leg wound. The patient's medical history included chronic renal failure, hypertension, and prior stroke after a hypoglycemia event. Prior to surgery while still on the hospital floor, the patient's blood glucose level fell precipitously after receiving insulin, requiring glucose several times. Due to workload, the nurse did not accompany the patient during transport to the operating room (OR). Instead, the nurse informed the transportation assistant about the patient's extreme sensitivity to insulin.

The transportation assistant neglected to pass this information on to the surgical nurse or the anesthesiologist. The electronic health record (EHR) did not reflect the glucose levels because the bedside glucose-monitoring device was not docked, so the information did not upload to the EHR for physician or nurse review. The patient spent 90 minutes in surgery and went to the recovery room where the blood sugar level was found to be 15 mg/dL, confirmed on repeat testing. Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly once he received intravenous glucose.

================================================================================

Title: Wrong Turn through Colon: Misplaced PEG

The Case:
An 87-year-old man was admitted for congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. In addition, a past cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with resulting dysphagia required placement of a feeding tube. The feeding tube was a percutaneously placed gastric tube, placed by gastroenterology 1 month before admission.

During hospitalization, the patient tolerated his tube feeds until hospital day 4, when he developed loose stools. The diarrhea progressed with liters of watery stool daily, necessitating placement of a rectal tube. Various stool studies were sent and failed to reveal an etiology. Bulking agents were added to his tube feeds but did not improve the consistency or volume of his stools. The primary team noted a remarkable similarity in appearance between the tube feeds and the stool. During a tube check, it was discovered that the tip of the feeding tube was in the colon and not the stomach.

On further investigation, it was determined that a loop of colon was overlying the stomach when the tube was placed. Consequently, while entering the stomach, the gastroenterologists inadvertently passed through the colon. Over time, a fistula formed between the stomach and the adjacent bowel (through which the tube passed during insertion); ultimately, the tube migrated back into the colon, which meant that the feedings were bypassing the entire digestive apparatus of the small intestine.

After the error was recognized, another tube was placed in the stomach and the previously placed tube was removed. However, the delay in identifying the problem resulted in sustained inadequate nutrition and significant decompensation.

================================================================================

Title: Residual Anesthesia: Tepid Burn

The Case:
A 42-year-old Filipino man presented to an outpatient surgery center for scheduled repair of an anal fistula. The patient received pre-procedure anesthesia with a "saddle block" and underwent a successful intervention. When his anesthesia block began to wear off, he was deemed safe for discharge and instructed to take sitz baths with tepid water.

One month later, the patient returned for a second evaluation under anesthesia, and the surgeon noted scarring on the patient's buttocks and proximal posterior thighs. There were also large areas of healed burns and associated skin changes. Additional history from the patient and his wife indicated that they misunderstood the term "tepid" and used scalding hot water for the sitz baths. It also appears the patient's slowly resolving saddle anesthesia in the first 24 hours home blunted his response to the hot water. Unfortunately, the patient did not seek additional medical attention. It was felt that challenges with both health literacy and language barriers contributed to the patient's failed understanding of discharge instructions.

================================================================================

Title: No News May Not Be Good News

The Case:
A 10-year-old girl with a history of asthma was brought by her mother (a nurse) to see a pediatrician because of a 15-pound weight loss over a period of 3 months. There were no notable changes in the child's diet or urination and there were no other systemic symptoms. A physical examination was unremarkable and the pediatrician ordered basic labs on a Thursday morning.

On Monday morning, the patient's mother called the pediatrician's office to obtain the results of the blood tests. The pediatrician was busy all day long but near the end of the day found the result. He was shocked to learn that the patient's blood sample, drawn on Thursday, had a glucose level of 320 mg/dL (normal random blood sugar: 70–125 mg/dL).

The pediatrician immediately contacted the mother and had her bring her daughter to the office. A repeat stat blood test showed that the patient's blood sugar was now 450 mg/dL and she had moderate ketones on a urinalysis (showing early signs of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life threatening). She was given insulin and specific instructions on management at home. The patient and mother had to return to the clinic each day for the next few days for ongoing management. The patient did not experience any long-term consequences.

When reviewing the case, the pediatrician was surprised that no one had been notified about the elevated blood sugar level. He came to learn that a fax of the laboratory results had been sent to the clinic on Saturday with the urgent result, but, for unclear reasons, the physician covering for the weekend never saw the result. This clinic did not have an electronic medical record (EMR).

================================================================================

Title: Sloppy and Paste

The Case:
A 78-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presented to an emergency department (ED) with new onset chest pain. The ED physician reviewed the patient's electronic medical record (EMR) and noted a history of "PE" listed under the Past Medical History section. This raised his suspicion for the possibility of a pulmonary embolus (PE). After initial testing excluded a cardiac etiology, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was ordered to rule out a PE. When the physician approached the patient to explain why he was ordering the diagnostic test, the patient denied ever having a PE or being treated with blood thinners.

Puzzled by the conflicting reports, the ED physician returned to the EMR and noted that this mistaken history of PE dated back several years. It even appeared in the "problem list" section of his EMR. Investigating further back, the ED physician discovered that the letters "PE" were first noted nearly a decade earlier where it was clearly intended to reflect a "physical examination" rather than a "pulmonary embolus." A physician likely copied and mistakenly pasted "PE" under "past medical history," after which this history of pulmonary embolism was carried forward time and time again. The patient, who was ultimately discharged from the ED, never suffered any harm from the documentation error. The EMR was updated to reflect, "This patient never had a pulmonary embolism."

================================================================================

Title: Misleading Complaint

The Case:
A 54-year-old homeless man with a history of alcoholism presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of knee problems. The triage nurse documented the chief complaint as "bilateral knee pain" and left the chart for the ED physician. The patient had not experienced any trauma to the knees and had no other symptoms; a focused physical examination of the knees was unremarkable. The ED physician diagnosed the patient with a musculoskeletal injury and prepared to discharge him. After receiving his discharge instructions, the patient tried to get up and walk but was noted to be unsteady. A subsequent full neurologic examination raised additional concerns and a diagnostic head computed tomography (CT) showed a subdural hematoma. The patient was admitted for urgent neurosurgical intervention.

Given the near miss of an unsafe discharge and the initial diagnostic error, the hospital's quality committee formally reviewed the case. The triage nurse reported that the patient used a number of vague and varied complaints about his knees, such as: "giving out," "couldn't walk on them," and "feeling wobbly." The nurse simply summarized the descriptions with the term "bilateral knee pain." The ED physician relied heavily on this documented triage complaint, leading to an overly focused history and examination.

================================================================================

Title: Comanagement: Who's in Charge?

The Case:
A 77-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted with a left hip fracture to the orthopedic surgery service, which has internal medicine hospitalists comanage its patients. The surgical repair went smoothly. On postoperative day 2, the patient was doing well when seen by the comanaging hospitalist. Later that day, the patient's oxygen requirement increased and the patient noted that he was feeling somewhat more short of breath compared to his baseline. The nurse notified the orthopedic surgery resident of the change in clinical status. A chest x-ray, ordered by orthopedics, showed new bilateral basilar consolidations. The orthopedic resident did not communicate these findings to the hospitalist, nor did he start antibiotics. The orthopedic resident assumed that the hospitalist was keeping up-to-date on developments and would initiate the appropriate treatment, while the hospitalist assumed that he would be contacted with any change in clinical status.

When the hospitalist next saw the patient (postoperative day 3), the patient was even more hypoxic. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram was done, which was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed much more extensive consolidations of his bilateral lung fields. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, the patient's respiratory status continued to decline. He was ultimately transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubated, and later died of hypoxic respiratory failure and sepsis (presumably from his pneumonia). It was believed that the delay in diagnosis of pneumonia and initiation of antibiotics may have contributed to the patient's downhill course.

================================================================================

Title: A Painful Dilemma

The Case:
A 47-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease was admitted with fever. She was taking propoxyphene or hydrocodone at home for pain. She has had multiple admissions associated with electrolyte abnormalities due to nonadherence with her outpatient dialysis schedule. Because her permanent arteriovenous (AV) graft normally used for dialysis was clotted and unusable, the patient had been receiving dialysis via a temporary catheter placed in her left femoral vein.

Given that her new presentation included fever, blood cultures were drawn, ultimately growing yeast. An echocardiogram revealed a large tricuspid valve vegetation. The patient's temporary dialysis catheter in her left femoral vein was removed and a new one placed in the right femoral vein. The unused clotted AV graft in the left arm remained in place, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital for consideration of surgery for fungal endocarditis.

The case management department reviewed this case. Their assessment was that the patient's nonadherence to dialysis led to clotting of her permanent AV graft, which necessitated use of temporary femoral vein access. Femoral intravenous catheters are associated with significantly increased risk of infection, including fungal infection, when compared with the use of permanent AV grafts. Moreover, the case management department felt that her nonadherence to dialysis was encouraged by the primary physician's prescription of opiates.

Although this patient was believed to be addicted to narcotics, she was never formally diagnosed with an addiction. Her providers suspected that she often intentionally skipped dialysis sessions, became uremic or volume overloaded, then presented to the emergency department for treatment and admission to the hospital. After admission, her primary physician would usually order intravenous (IV) hydromorphone (Dilaudid) to be given for "body pain." The patient would ask the nurses to "push the hydromorphone fast" and flush after the medication (saying that the previous nurse would push it fast) and ask for dose escalation. When a substance abuse evaluation was recommended to the patient, she repeatedly declined it.

Title: Transfer Troubles

The Case:
An orthopedic surgeon at a small community hospital contacted an emergency department (ED) physician at a large academic medical center about a patient transfer. At this hospital, standard procedure called for all transfers from outside hospitals to be seen and evaluated in the ED. The orthopedic surgeon briefly described a 92-year-old woman with a history of dementia who had a left hip fracture. They had taken her to the operating room, but she developed low blood pressure before the case and the anesthesiologists were not comfortable managing her care at the community hospital. The referring orthopedic surgeon also spoke with the on-call orthopedic surgery resident at the tertiary care center and conveyed the same brief history. Minimal other clinical details were discussed.

The patient was transferred to the tertiary care center and was clinically stable on arrival to the ED. None of the notes or clinical documentation from the referring hospital arrived with the patient other than her demographic data. She was quickly admitted by the orthopedic surgery resident and prepped for surgery the following morning.

Early the next day, the patient was taken to the operating room for surgical repair of her hip fracture. During induction of anesthesia, the patient rapidly became hypotensive and required vasopressors. The surgical team proceeded, but the case was complicated by significant hemodynamic instability. The patient survived the surgery, but experienced persistent postoperative hypotension (shock) of unclear cause and could not be weaned from the ventilator. Ultimately, care was withdrawn and she died a few days after surgery.

Notably, following her operation on hospital day 2, medical records arrived from the referring hospital and the anesthesia notes were reviewed. They were handwritten and difficult to read but described "profound hypotension" at the start of the case and that the patient had actually suffered a full cardiac arrest (written as "unable to obtain BP...no palpable pulse...arterial access...case cancelled, to PACU."). There were few other details in any of the notes about the cardiac arrest.

Although it was not completely clear to the orthopedic team or anesthesiologists what happened, all agreed that her case would have been managed much differently had they known more about the events at the referring hospital and that such knowledge could have potentially prevented her death.

Title: The Forgotten Line

The Case:
An 81-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular accidents, and chronic kidney disease was transferred to a referral hospital for percutaneous coronary intervention after presenting to a community hospital with hypotension and chest pain. At the community hospital, a central venous catheter was placed in the patient's right internal jugular vein for administration of vasopressors. When he arrived at the referral hospital, he was hemodynamically stable and the vasopressors had been discontinued for an unspecified period of time, although the central line remained in place "just in case." The patient underwent successful stenting of his coronary arteries and was discharged to an assisted living facility within 48 hours of admission.

On arrival at the assisted living facility, it was discovered that the central line was still in place. The caregivers at the assisted living facility noticed the line and returned the patient to the referral hospital the same day to have the central line safely removed. The incident was reported and investigated, revealing several contributing factors. First, the patient was a transfer who was admitted late at night, and who was signed out the next morning as 1 of 12 holdovers to the admitting teams. Second, it was "switch day" for the interns and early in the academic year, so many of them were still getting used to a new system. Third, the line had been placed somewhere else, for an indication (hypotension) that no longer existed, and it had not been used at any point during his 48-hour admission. Lastly, while the nurse noticed the line during the routine predischarge examination, she assumed that the patient was supposed to be discharged with it in place and did not call anyone from the medical team to get clarification.

================================================================================

Title: Double Dose at Transfer

The Case:
A 74-year-old man with history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to the emergency department (ED) for left lower extremity pain, swelling, and erythema. The ED physician made the diagnosis of cellulitis and prescribed vancomycin, 1 g IV every 12 hours. The patient's first dose was administered in the ED.

Approximately 6 hours after admission to the ED (and just 3 hours after receipt of his first vancomycin dose), the patient was transferred to a medical–surgical floor. The admitting nurse noted the vancomycin order on the admission order set and—unaware that the patient had received a dose in the ED—administered another dose.

Physicians may write "delayed admission orders" that are activated upon ward admission. However, in patients with longer ED stays, some of those delayed admission orders are carried out in the ED. In this instance, the respective ED and ward systems were not linked, limiting tracking of medication administration in the respective units. Similarly, the pharmacy system at this hospital did not capture outpatient versus ED versus ward dispensing of medications.

A physician who was aware the patient had received a dose of vancomycin in the ED realized the mistake and ordered a serum vancomycin level. While the patient was confirmed to have an elevated level, he experienced no associated toxicities, and his dosing resumed on the appropriate schedule.

================================================================================

Title: The Perils of Cross Coverage

The Case:
A 70-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute change in mental status a few days after lumbar laminectomy. Her medical history was significant for a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus. She was febrile with nuchal rigidity. Her white blood cell (WBC) count was over 20,000 cells/μl. Blood cultures were positive forE. coli,and appropriate antibiotic therapy was initiated. The patient responded well—she began to have brief but meaningful conversation with her family. Her WBC started to trend down, and she was afebrile for 48 hours.

On day 4 of her ICU admission, a Friday, she exhibited fluctuating mental status with prolonged episodes of drowsiness. The ICU team attributed this to recent use of sedatives. Signout to the incoming night float team did not highlight the change in mental status. Over the course of the ensuing night she became drowsier. The night float team assumed it was her baseline mental status. After transfer to the incoming cross-covering team for the weekend, the patient was found comatose.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed ventriculitis with possible infectious cerebritis. The patient developed generalized tonic clonic seizures and was treated with IV phenytoin. She was emergently transferred to surgery for removal of the VP shunt and placement of ventricular drain for intraventricular gentamycin. The patient received 8 days of intraventricular gentamycin with resolution of ventriculitis as documented by negativeE. colicultures from the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. She made a gradual recovery after spending 6 weeks in the ICU.

Subsequent root cause analysis determined that earlier recognition of the change in mental status might have altered the patient's course. It identified inadequate signout to the night float team as the primary reason why that team did not identify the patient's deteriorating mental status.

Title: Turn the Other Cheek

The Case:
A 56-year-old man underwent two skin biopsies to evaluate clinically concerning lesions. The first biopsy was diagnostic for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and documented as "left cheek" in the health record. The second biopsy was consistent with an atrophic solar keratosis (a benign finding) and the site was documented as "left inferior orbit."

The patient was then referred to a dermatologic surgeon to have his SCC excised. The accompanying referral documentation included a diagram of a face with the SCC biopsy site marked by an "X" on the left cheek. The pathology report included a description of the anatomic location that was also noted as "left cheek." On the day of surgery, standard preprocedure verification was completed. The surgery site was marked after the patient confirmed the biopsy site with use of a mirror, two physicians identified a biopsy scar within a clinical lesion on the left cheek, the diagram from the referring physician was reviewed, and the anatomic description of the site from the pathology report was confirmed. The surgeon then excised a lesion on the left cheek.

The patient returned to his referring physician, who immediately realized that the wrong lesion (the benign solar keratosis) had been excised. The patient returned to the surgeon to report the mistake. On closer review, he realized that the actual site of the SCC was, while nominally on the left cheek, more specifically near the preauricular skin. The lesion excised was the one referred to as "left inferior orbit" rather than "left cheek"—an error that resulted from ambiguity in the description and the patient's self-identification of the wrong lesion. The patient required a second surgical excision to remove the SCC lesion.

Title: Cultural Dimensions of Depression

The Case:
A 55-year-old Vietnamese man was admitted to a general medicine ward with vague complaints of inability to breathe and swallow. The patient had been living in the United States for 20 years and currently was unemployed, with a wife and two children. He spoke English reasonably well; nevertheless, the history was obtained with a translation service. The patient was anxious and repeatedly stated that he was "dying" from his physical ailments. Extensive workup showed no evidence of cancer, but revealed reflux disease and Zenker diverticulum (an outpouching) of the esophagus. Psychiatric evaluation ruled out major depression. In the midst of a gastroenterology consult (to obtain an esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]) the patient ran to the bathroom, jumped out of the fifth floor window, and killed himself.

After this event, subsequent discussions with the family revealed some relevant details. The patient had lived through the Vietnam War; he and his family had come to the United States on a boat as part of a mass exodus in the late 1970s; there was strife within the family unit, as the patient felt he was an undue burden to them; and the family was "losing face" in their community due to his unemployment.

The psychiatric team concluded that the evaluation had not been sufficiently sensitive to identify important culture-specific clues related to depression and has since taken steps to incorporate culturally sensitive screening tools.

Title: Postdischarge Follow-Up Phone Call

The Case:
A 63-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with several days of a productive cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Based on her clinical history, physical exam, and diagnostic studies, she was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and admitted to the hospital. She was treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline, intravenous fluids, and supportive care. The patient improved rapidly over 48 hours and was discharged home (she lived with her daughter and grandson) with a prescription for doxycycline (an oral antibiotic) to complete a 7-day course and guaifenesin for a persistent cough.

Over the next few days following discharge, the patient's cough worsened, and the shortness of breath returned despite taking antibiotics. She called her primary care physician (PCP) to schedule an urgent appointment, but he was out of the country, and no appointments were available in the clinic. She also vaguely remembered being given a number at the hospital to call if she had any issues at home, but she could not locate the number in the large stack of papers she was given at discharge. As her symptoms worsened, she contemplated returning to the emergency department (ED).

That afternoon, she received a phone call from the hospital where she had been discharged. At this hospital, all patients discharged from the medicine service are called by a nurse within 3 days. The nurse asked a standard list of questions and learned about the worsening symptoms.

The nurse contacted the discharging team regarding the worsening cough and shortness of breath. The team was concerned that her pneumonia was returning and she was failing the doxycycline treatment. They contacted her local pharmacy and were able to prescribe levofloxacin (a broader spectrum antibiotic). The patient's daughter was able to get the prescription the same day and the patient began taking the levofloxacin.

The nurse who had called previously called again 2 days later to check on the patient. With the change in antibiotics, the patient felt much better with improving symptoms. She did not need to return to the hospital and was able to see her primary care doctor 2 weeks later. The discharging team was convinced that the follow-up phone call by the nurse had definitely prevented a return visit to the ED and potentially a readmission to the hospital.

================================================================================

Title: Amended Lab Results: Communication Slip

The Case:
A 25-year-old woman in her first pregnancy was seen at 33 weeks' gestation with new onset hypertension and a blood pressure of 140–150/90 mm Hg. Urinalysis revealed 2+ protein (100 mg/dL) on a random urine dipstick, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio was 0.5 mg/dL (normal up to 0.3 mg/dL). With a potential diagnosis of preeclampsia (new onset hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy), she was admitted to the hospital for observation, fetal testing, and laboratory studies, including a 24-hour urine protein collection. In the absence of proteinuria, this syndrome is considered gestational hypertension, a less serious diagnosis, managed as an outpatient with either observation or antihypertensive medications.

The laboratory studies and 24-hour urine collection for proteinuria were checked by the obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) resident in the hospital electronic medical record (EMR), where they were reported as normal. Assuming a diagnosis of gestational hypertension, the resident initiated discharge planning, including management with antihypertensive medications. However, the attending physician, noting the inconsistency between the dipstick proteinuria and negative result on the 24-hour urine, rechecked the laboratory results. Upon recheck, he observed that the laboratory had amended the report confirming the 24-hour protein collection was actually elevated and abnormal, confirming the diagnosis of preeclampsia. The patient's discharge was canceled.

In this instance, the amended laboratory result was recognized prior to discharge and a new management plan, which involved continued observation in the hospital, was implemented. No harm was done to the patient. She remained in the hospital for 5 days and was induced at 34 weeks for worsening preeclampsia. The mother and infant ultimately did well.

On later review, it was determined that the nature of this error centered upon the communication of an amended test or report. Although this hospital's policy mandated that the inpatient unit be notified about amended laboratory reports, notifying the physician was not part of the mandate. Consequently, the ordering physician was not alerted to the change in the laboratory report.

================================================================================

Title: Poorly Advanced Directives

The Case:
Cared for at home by his wife and family, an 82-year-old man with multiple chronic medical conditions described his overall health as declining recently. He saw a primary care physician, received home nurse visits, and had recently been referred to a geriatrician. The primary physician realized the need for end-of-life discussions but always ran of out of time due to the complexity and acuity of the patient's medical conditions.

One afternoon, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) and was admitted to the hospital for delirium, an underlying infection, and acute kidney injury. During the hospitalization, the primary team engaged the patient and his family in advanced directive discussions, and the patient ultimately decided (with his family's blessing) on a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) order. After treatment for his infection, he returned to his baseline health status and was discharged home. The change in code status was communicated to the patient's primary physician.

Two days later, the patient returned to the same ED with altered mental status and impending respiratory failure. En route, the paramedic asked the distraught family members about advanced directives and they expressed a desire that "everything be done" to save their loved one. Despite the previously documented DNR/DNI order, the patient was intubated and remained on mechanical ventilation for 3 days. The family ultimately decided to withdraw life-sustaining interventions, and the patient died peacefully soon afterward.

================================================================================

Title: Missing the Point—Eye Injury

The Case:
A 31-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) after suffering multiple lacerations during an assault. The patient stated it was unclear what weapon the assailant had used, but she thought it was a sharp blade of some kind. She had two linear lacerations on her right arm that were superficial and did not require suturing.

She also had a 3 cm linear laceration over her right eyelid. She denied any pain in the eye or vision changes. On examination, her pupillary response and ocular movements were intact. The ED provider did not formally check her visual acuity but asked her to close each eye separately and asked her if she noted any change in her vision (which she did not). The ED provider everted the lid (turned it up to see underneath) and the laceration did not appear to extend through the eyelid. He performed a fluorescence examination and did not note any corneal abrasion or evidence of injury to the globe. The eyelid laceration was sutured without complication. An ophthalmologist was not consulted.

The patient presented to a different hospital 10 days later complaining of eye pain. At that time, she reported to providers that her vision had been poor in the right eye since the attack. She was referred to an ophthalmologist and found to have a ruptured globe. She was taken to the operating room for repair and found to have a 4 mm cut in the cornea that extended 7 mm into the sclera (globe of the eye). This laceration was directly beneath the laceration in her eyelid. The defects in the cornea and sclera were repaired, but she had some residual pain and mild visual deficits after the procedure.
