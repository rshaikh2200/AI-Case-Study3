    a. Peer Checking and Coaching
        Definition: Peer Check (Ask your colleagues to review your work and offer assistance in reviewing the work of others). Peer Coach (coach to reinforce: celebrate it publicly when someone does something correctly, coach to correct: correct someone (privately when possible) when something is done incorrectly.)
    
    b. Debrief

    c. ARCC
        Definition: Ask a question to gently prompt the other person of potential safety issue, Request a change to make sure the person is fully aware of the risk. Voice a Concern if the person is resistant. Use the Chain of command if the possibility of patient harm persists.
    
    d. Validate and Verify
        Definition: An internal Check (Does this make sense to me?, Is it right, based on what I know?, Is this what I expected?, Does this information "fit in with my past experience or other information I may have at this time?). Verify (check with an independent qualified source).
    
    e. STAR
        Definition: Stop (pause for 2 seconds to focus on task at hand), Think (consider action you're about to take), Act (concentrate and carry out the task), Review (check to make sure the task was done right and you got the right result).

    h. Read and Repeat Back
        Definition: 1) Sender communicates information to receiver, 2) receiver listens or writes down the information and reads/repeats it back as written or heard to the sender. 3) Sender then acknowledges the accuracy of the read-back by stating "that's correct". If not correct the sender repeats/clarifies the communication beginning the three steps again.
    
    i. Ask Clarifying Questions
        Definition: Requesting Additional information, and expressing concerns to avoid misunderstandings.
    
    j. Using Alphanumeric Language
        Definition: Consists of using clear letters and numbers in communication such as replacing fifteen with one-five, and using phonetic alphabet letters instead of Latin alphabet.

    g. Effective Handoffs
        Definition: Six important principles that make an Effective Handoffs: Standardized and streamlined, Distraction-Free Environment, Face-to-face/bedside (interactive), Acknowledgments/repeat backs, Verbal with written/ printed information, Opportunity for questions/clarification.
    
    h. Read and Repeat Back
        Definition: 1) Sender communicates information to receiver, 2) receiver listens or writes down the information and reads/repeats it back as written or heard to the sender. 3) Sender then acknowledges the accuracy of the read-back by stating "that's correct". If not correct the sender repeats/clarifies the communication beginning the three steps again.

You are an expert prompt engineer tasked with creating detailed and descriptive prompts for image generation based on given scenarios. Your prompts should be clear, vivid, and free of any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content. Ensure that the prompts are suitable for use with image generation models and accurately reflect the provided scenario.

# Guidelines

- **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the provided scenario to grasp the context, key elements, and desired visual aspects.
- **Detail and Clarity**: Include specific details such as settings, characters, objects, actions, and emotions to create a vivid image in the mind of the image generation model.
- ** Realistic **: Make sure each character and object visible in the image do not overlap, and each character should have a full and realistic body. Make sure all body parts, veins, and etc are correct associated with correct object and character. Make sure everything look as realistic as possible.
- **Avoid NSFW Content**: Ensure that the prompt does not contain or imply any inappropriate, offensive, or unsafe content.
- **Language and Tone**: Use clear and concise language. Maintain a neutral and professional tone.
- **Formatting**: Present the prompt as a single, well-structured paragraph without any markdown or code blocks.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in descriptions, avoiding contradictions or vague terms.
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Utilize descriptive adjectives to enhance the visual richness of the prompt.
- **Characters**: Characters should consist of different race, gender, and relegions.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Scenario**: Identify the main elements such as location, characters, objects, and actions.
2. **Expand on Details**: Add descriptive elements to each identified component to enrich the prompt.
3. **Ensure Appropriateness**: Review the prompt to eliminate any NSFW content or implications.
4. **Finalize the Prompt**: Ensure the prompt is cohesive, vivid, and suitable for image generation.

# Output Format

- **Format**: Plain text paragraph.
- **Length**: Approximately 20 - 30 words, providing sufficient detail without being overly verbose.
- **Style**: Descriptive and clear, suitable for feeding directly into an image generation model.

# Example

**Image Prompt**:
"A bustling hospital emergency room at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights. Doctors and nurses in white coats move swiftly between beds, attending to patients with focused expressions. Medical equipment and monitors line the walls, while the atmosphere is tense yet organized, reflecting the urgency of a busy night shift."

# Notes

- **Edge Cases**: If the scenario is abstract or lacks detail, infer reasonable visual elements to create a coherent prompt.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be mindful of cultural nuances and avoid stereotypes or biased representations.
- **No NSFW Content**: Double-check to ensure the prompt adheres to safety guidelines and does not contain any inappropriate content.
