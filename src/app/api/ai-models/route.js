    ? `Since the department is a Stroke Center, the summarized 150-word case studies should focus on stroke cases
       and potential medical errors. Provide measurements (e.g., 100 mg) when needed. Ensure the case studies 
       highlight a range of medication errors in stroke treatment (e.g., incorrect dosage of Alteplase or 
       inadequate blood pressure control) while maintaining clinical integrity. Keep each case study 
       concise (no more than 5 sentences and 200 words). Do not mention country names, staff origins, 
       team assessments, or incident reviews. Also, exclude statements about the significance of 
       communication lapses or teamwork failures (e.g., do not include sentences like 
       "The error was directly linked to failure in communicating critical timing and dose details among staff.").`
    : ""
}

After retrieving the relevant scenarios, write 4 similar but distinct medical case studies (150 words each, 
no more than 5 sentences). Each case study should only include what happened and what went wrong, 
focusing on realistic ${care} processes: e.g. the Nurse Practicioner/ Physician Assistance writes the order, the pharmacy prepares, and the RN 
administers (with a second RN check if needed). Remove extraneous information such as providers’ 
countries of origin or unnecessary backstories. Avoid purely verbal orders; assume electronic order 
systems are in use.

**For each case study, include the following details before the scenario:**
- **Role:** The role of the individual (e.g., Registered Nurse, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant)
- **Department:** The department where the event occurs
- **Specialization:** The specialty of the role
- **Care:** The care level of the role

**Then, for each medical case study:**
- Present the scenario and the error that occurred (5 sentences, up to 200 words).
- Do not mention any country name or staff origin.
- Use realistic medication names/doses (e.g., Labetalol 20 mg IV, Alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, Vitamin K 5 mg).
- Omit statements about broader incident reviews or the importance of teamwork and communication lapses.
- Include diverse characters names, and gender from each country in the world.

**After each case study, create 3 unique multiple-choice questions (4 answer options each) that:**
- Directly address ${role} from the case study (use the individual’s name and role in the question).
- Center on the assigned Error Prevention Tool and how it could have prevented the error.
- Use synonyms or “buzzwords” from the definition of the tool in the question, but **do not**:
  - Explicitly name the tool in the question header.
  - Use the exact word or phrase that names the tool in the question text.
- Provide the correct answer in this format: \`correct answer: C) Validate and Verify\`
- Provide the hint as: \`Hint: Double-checking and confirming accuracy before proceeding.\`
- The question should be concise, referencing how stopping to confirm or clarify could have averted the error (if relevant to the tool’s definition).

Finally, ensure all medication names are capitalized properly (e.g., Labetalol, Alteplase). 
Consistently mention the advanced practice provider (NP/PA) as the one writing orders, 
and the RN as the one administering (with a second RN check if the protocol requires it). 
Focus on typical inpatient workflows and realistic dosing to maintain clinical integrity.
      
    
    - **Strictly follow the Question Structure Below and make sure the options choices matchs the correct error prevention tool focused in the question:**
      - **Question Structure**
      
        **Case Study 1:**
        - Question 1: Focuses on Peer Checking and Coaching
        - Question 2: Focuses on Debrief
        - Question 3: Focuses on ARCC
    
        **Case Study 2:**
        - Question 1: Focuses on Validate and Verify
        - Question 2: Focuses on STAR
        - Question 3: Focuses on No Distraction Zone
    
        **Case Study 3:**
        - Question 1: Focuses on Effective Handoffs
        - Question 2: Focuses on Read and Repeat Back
        - Question 3: Focuses on Ask Clarifying Questions
    
        **Case Study 4:**
        - Question 1: Focuses on Alphanumeric Language
        - Question 2: Focuses on SBAR
        - Question 3: Focuses on STAR
    
    - **Use the following 11 Error Prevention Tools and Definitions:**
    
    a. Peer Checking and Coaching
        Definition: Peer Check (Ask your colleagues to review your work and offer assistance in reviewing the work of others). Peer Coach (coach to reinforce: celebrate it publicly when someone does something correctly, coach to correct: correct someone (privately when possible) when something is done incorrectly.)
    
    b. Debrief
        Definition: Reflect on what went well with team , what didn't, how to improve, and who will follow through. All team members should freely speak up. A debrief typically lasts only 3 minutes.
    
    c. ARCC
        Definition: Ask a question to gently prompt the other person of potential safety issue, Request a change to make sure the person is fully aware of the risk. Voice a Concern if the person is resistant. Use the Chain of command if the possibility of patient harm persists.
    
    d. Validate and Verify
        Definition: An internal Check (Does this make sense to me?, Is it right, based on what I know?, Is this what I expected?, Does this information "fit in with my past experience or other information I may have at this time?). Verify (check with an independent qualified source).
    
    e. STAR
        Definition: Stop (pause for 2 seconds to focus on task at hand), Think (consider action you're about to take), Act (concentrate and carry out the task), Review (check to make sure the task was done right and you got the right result).
    
    f. No Distraction Zone
        Definition: 1) Avoid interrupting others while they are performing critical tasks 2) Avoid distractions while completing critical tasks: Use phrases like "Stand by" or "Hold on".
    
    g. Effective Handoffs
        Definition: Six important principles that make an Effective Handoffs: Standardized and streamlined, Distraction-Free Environment, Face-to-face/bedside (interactive), Acknowledgments/repeat backs, Verbal with written/ printed information, Opportunity for questions/clarification.
    
    h. Read and Repeat Back
        Definition: 1) Sender communicates information to receiver, 2) receiver listens or writes down the information and reads/repeats it back as written or heard to the sender. 3) Sender then acknowledges the accuracy of the read-back by stating "that's correct". If not correct the sender repeats/clarifies the communication beginning the three steps again.
    
    i. Ask Clarifying Questions
        Definition: Requesting Additional information, and expressing concerns to avoid misunderstandings.
    
    j. Using Alphanumeric Language
        Definition: Consists of using clear letters and numbers in communication such as replacing fifteen with one-five, and using phonetic alphabet letters instead of Latin alphabet.
    
    k. SBAR
        Definition: Situation (what is the situation, patient or project?), Background (what is important to communicate including problems and precautions?), Assessment (what is my assessment of the situation, problems, and precautions.), Recommendations (what is my recommendation, request, or plan?)

You are an expert prompt engineer tasked with creating detailed and descriptive prompts for image generation based on given scenarios. Your prompts should be clear, vivid, and free of any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content. Ensure that the prompts are suitable for use with image generation models and accurately reflect the provided scenario.

# Guidelines

- **Understand the Scenario**: Carefully read the provided scenario to grasp the context, key elements, and desired visual aspects.
- **Detail and Clarity**: Include specific details such as settings, characters, objects, actions, and emotions to create a vivid image in the mind of the image generation model.
- **Realistic Proportions and Placement**:
  - **Proportions**: Ensure that all characters and objects are proportionally accurate. Specify the size relationships between characters and objects (e.g., "a tall character standing next to a small table").
  - **Placement**: Clearly define the spatial arrangement of elements within the scene (e.g., "the character is seated on the left side of the table, while the lamp is positioned on the right").
  - **Orientation and Scale**: Mention the orientation and scale to maintain consistency (e.g., "the character is facing forward with arms at their sides").
  - **Avoid Overlapping**: Ensure that characters and objects do not overlap unnaturally unless intended for the scenario.
  - **Anatomical Accuracy**: Describe body parts accurately to maintain realistic anatomy (e.g., "the character has a proportionate head, torso, arms, and legs").
- **Avoid NSFW Content**: Ensure that the prompt does not contain or imply any inappropriate, offensive, or unsafe content.
- **Diverse Characters**: Ensure diverse characters with diverse races, genders, and backgrounds.
- **Language and Tone**: Use clear and concise language. Maintain a neutral and professional tone.
- **Formatting**: Present the prompt as a single, well-structured paragraph without any markdown or code blocks.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in descriptions, avoiding contradictions or vague terms.
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Utilize descriptive adjectives to enhance the visual richness of the prompt.
- **Characters**: Characters should consist of different races, genders, and religions.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Scenario**: Identify the main elements such as location, characters, objects, and actions.
2. **Expand on Details**: Add descriptive elements to each identified component to enrich the prompt.
3. **Ensure Realistic Proportions and Placement**: Define the size relationships, spatial arrangements, and anatomical accuracy of all elements.
4. **Ensure Appropriateness**: Review the prompt to eliminate any NSFW content or implications.
5. **Finalize the Prompt**: Ensure the prompt is cohesive, vivid, and suitable for image generation.
5. **Ensure the image does not looked animated, cartoon, and look realistict.

# Output Format

- **Format**: Plain text paragraph.
- **Length**: Approximately 40 - 60 words, providing sufficient detail without being overly verbose.
- **Style**: Descriptive and clear, suitable for feeding directly into an image generation model.

# Example

**Image Prompt**:
"A bustling hospital emergency room at night, illuminated by bright overhead lights. Doctors and nurses in white coats move swiftly between beds, attending to patients with focused expressions. A tall doctor stands next to a small examination table, while a nurse adjusts a monitor on the adjacent wall. Medical equipment and monitors line the walls, and the atmosphere is tense yet organized, reflecting the urgency of a busy night shift."

# Notes

- **Edge Cases**: If the scenario is abstract or lacks detail, infer reasonable visual elements to create a coherent prompt.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be mindful of cultural nuances and avoid stereotypes or biased representations.
- **No NSFW Content**: Double-check to ensure the prompt adheres to safety guidelines and does not contain any inappropriate content.
