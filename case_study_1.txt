Title: A Fatal Twist in Pseudohyperkalemia

The Case:
A 54-year-old man with a history of tobacco use presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of acute chest pain. The pain was intermittent, began 2-3 weeks prior, lasted several minutes to hours in duration, and radiated to his left arm. The patient thought the pain was related to his diet and put himself on a juice cleanse one week before his presentation. On arrival at the ED, he was afebrile, heart rate was 98 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure was 103/87 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was normal on supplemental oxygen. On physical examination, the patient had bibasilar rales and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema. His 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block (RBBB). There was also prolongation of the QT interval, flattened T waves, and small U waves that were not recognized by either the machine or the ED physician. Laboratory tests were notable for hyponatremia to 126 mEq/L, hyperkalemia to 5.9 mEq/L, elevated creatinine to 1.4 mg/dL, moderately elevated troponin, and normal serum magnesium and calcium. The lab sample was reported as hemolyzed, but this finding was not recognized by the treating physician. Chest x-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion.

The patient subsequently developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at approximately 120 bpm. Cardiology was consulted and recommended initiation of heparin, amiodarone, and metoprolol. The patient also received treatment for hyperkalemia with albuterol, intravenous calcium, insulin with 50% dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, and furosemide. Soon after receiving these medications, he became unresponsive and pulseless. Torsades de pointes (TdP) was present on telemetry, though this was interpreted as ventricular fibrillation (VF) and treated with epinephrine, amiodarone, and sodium bicarbonate. Despite routine resuscitative efforts, return of spontaneous circulation was not achieved. Autopsy confirmed sudden cardiac arrest without myocardial infarction as the cause of death.

Title: Don’t Wait to Collect an Accurate Weight: A Case of Subtherapeutic Insulin Therapy

The Case:
A 16-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of dizziness, fatigue and a “high” reading on her home blood glucose monitor. Initial laboratory tests suggested diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), consistent with the clinician’s impression that the patient's insulin pump was malfunctioning. Despite aggressive treatment with insulin drip at a basal rate of 0.1 unit/kg, her blood glucose remained high and the anion gap closed much slower than expected, given that this patient had a history of DKA episodes that had previously responded rapidly to insulin infusion.

Late on day 2 of the admission, it was discovered that the admitting nurse and resident in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) had used the patient weight recorded in the ED to calculate and verify the insulin drip rate. Their rationale was that it was late, and the patient was tired when she arrived to the PICU. Her actual weight was 30 kg more than the weight documented in two different electronic health record (EHR) systems. Root cause analysis revealed that the weight in the ED had been marked as "stated" by the patient, which the patient verified when asked, but she had simply guessed at what she might weigh. Once the patient's weight was corrected and her insulin dose was adjusted, she improved quickly and her DKA resolved within 12 hours.

Title: Infection After Carpal Tunnel Surgery

The Case:
A woman presented for surgery on her right wrist as a treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. There were no reported complications during the operation, and the patient was discharged from the hospital the same day. Before discharge, the surgeon instructed her to return in 10 days for suture removal. The surgeon also told the patient not to soak her hand in water, which would reduce the risk of infection. A nurse provided written discharge instructions that stated, “Keep hand clean and dry until sutures removed; no soaking hand in water.” Within three or four days, the patient reported that her wrist felt “warm” to the touch, and the incision area was red. The patient contacted the surgeon’s office and spoke to the medical assistant (MA), but no action was taken. The patient called the surgeon’s office multiple times, asking for more or different pain medications, which were refused. The MA did not document each call but reportedly discussed each call with the surgeon. The MA stated that the patient never reported that the wound was red, hot, foul-smelling, swollen, or anything else suggesting an infection. Approximately 7 to 10 days after the operation, the patient returned for suture removal. The surgeon’s MA removed the patient’s sutures and noted that the wound was not infected or swollen. The surgeon’s physician assistant (PA) also examined the patient and did not find any remaining sutures, nor did she see any infection or redness. One day later, the patient called and asked to see the surgeon, but she was denied because the MA said her wrist was “fine.” The patient continued to report pain, swelling, and redness, noted that her wrist began to ooze at the incision, and reported an odd smell. She called several times, but no follow-up visit was scheduled. The MA claimed that the patient never mentioned redness or pain after the sutures were removed, and if she had reported such symptoms, the MA would have immediately brought the patient in and told the surgeon.

Two weeks after surgery, the patient went to an emergency department (ED) seeking treatment for worsening wrist pain. ED physicians diagnosed an infection, prescribed antibiotics, and told the patient to schedule an appointment with her surgeon. Three days after the ED visit, the patient spoke to the surgeon’s office and made a follow-up appointment for the next day. At that appointment, the surgeon recommended immediate surgery to treat the infection. The patient remained in the hospital for 11 days, during which she underwent two additional operations. She eventually recovered but lost significant use of her right hand.

Title: Multiple Missed Opportunities for Suicide Risk Assessment in Emergency and Primary Care Settings

The Case:
An 18-year-old man with a reported history of untreated depression and suicide attempts at age 13 (with cutting behaviors and over-ingestion of medication), but no history of psychiatric hospitalizations, was seen in the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation. He reported feeling more depressed lately. He had been open with his older brother about suicidal thoughts for some time, but 2 days prior to presentation, he became intoxicated and reported having purchased a gun, but did not disclose details. After the brother disclosed this information to their mother, emergency medical services (EMS) brought the patient to a local ED. He initially reported taking 10 ibuprofen tablets, although he later denied this quantity.

The patient was not on any psychiatric medications and did not have an outpatient therapist or psychiatrist. He denied auditory and visual hallucinations, had no somatic complaints, denied illicit substance use but did endorse alcohol use and occasional cannabis use. He had stable vital signs, was calm and cooperative, and displayed a stable affect. Due to suicidal ideation, he was placed on safety hold and a psychiatric consultation was requested. Laboratory studies were only remarkable for a positive cannabis result on urine toxicology screen. The Psychiatry team’s recommendation was for discharge with outpatient therapy. The patient’s mother agreed with this plan. He was discharged with outpatient resources, the crisis hotline phone number, and strict return precautions.

One month later, the patient had his first visit with his new primary care physician (PCP). He was again sent to an ED after he described a suicidal gesture consisting of superficial cutting of his wrist with a kitchen knife several days earlier, which he stated was in reaction to a recent romantic disappointment. In the ED, he was placed on emergency hold civil commitment for “persons posing risk of serious harm by reason of mental illness.” However, he stated that the thoughts of hurting himself had passed quickly, and he had no plan to hurt or kill himself or anyone else. He denied any safety concerns at home--he reported living alone but was looking forward to moving in with his brother in 1 week and noted strong family support in the area. He cited future-orientation including enjoying working in a hotel. The Psychiatry team recommended that the patient was safe for discharge with outpatient follow-up, which was arranged. They also recommended that patient start an antidepressant medication, but the patient declined, stating he does not like to take medications.

Ten days later, the patient had a follow-up phone visit with his PCP. He mentioned that two days prior, he had been up all-night sending texts to a girl and felt “manic,” or restless with racing thoughts. He reported recurrent thoughts of harming himself but no plan and no self-injurious behavior. He thought that he would be able to manage these feelings himself as he did not want to kill himself and did not want to go to the ED again. The only medication he expressed interest in taking was “a stimulant for his ADHD,” which he self-diagnosed due to his impulsivity. The patient’s PCP felt he would likely benefit from inpatient psychiatric care but documented that he denied suicidal ideation or an active plan. Nonetheless, the PCP was quite concerned and scheduled a therapy appointment for the next day, with a plan for the therapist to call the patient later in the day.

Later that day, the patient was found with a loaded gun in a hotel room. He said he was about to shoot himself in the head. He called his mother, who called the police, who quickly came and took him to the ED for the third time. There he was evaluated and involuntarily admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for five weeks. He was ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of “Bipolar 1 – moderate-severe with mixed features.” Suicide risk at discharge was assessed as being “chronic risk which was mildly elevated,” although he did well with no known instances of suicidality or suicide attempts in the next six months of follow-up.

Title: Culture Clash No More: Integration and Coordination of Disease Treatment and Palliative Care

The Case:
A 77-year-old man with no significant medical history initially presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for abdominal pain. During the patient's evaluation, he was found to have a rectal mass. The patient declined any surgical intervention or chemotherapy after discussing goals of care with an oncologist. He underwent two rounds of targeted radiotherapy and then was lost to follow up. The patient re-presented to the ED after a fall at home. He had been living independently. In the ED, slight left sided weakness was noted that contributed to dysarthria, difficulty ambulating, bathing/toileting, and feeding himself. Lung and brain imaging revealed new metastatic lesions in both lungs and numerous enhancing lesions in the brain. The patient was started on high dose steroids to reduce cerebral edema. Further discussions of the goals of care revealed that the patient desired to focus on comfort and on maintaining independence for as long as possible. He was discharged to an inpatient hospice for comfort care.

The inpatient hospice team discussed the potential role of brain radiotherapy for palliation to meet the goal of maintaining independence. The patient agreed to a radiation oncology evaluation and successfully completed a course of central nervous system (CNS) radiation in five divided doses. The patient’s strength, energy, and speech improved, and he was able to feed himself, groom himself, and ambulate several feet with assistance. He was able to spend time with his friends and family and have clear conversations with them and participate in activities due to his improved function.

Title: Hidden Danger! Insidious Postpartum Bleeding After Emergency Cesarean Delivery.

The Case:
A 32-year-old pregnant woman presented to Labor and Delivery with prelabor rupture of membranes at 37 weeks’ gestation. She had significant obstetric history with 5 prior vaginal deliveries, all at term, with no attendant complications. The fetal heart rate (FHR) at presentation was category 2, described as moderate variability with normal baseline; accelerations were present with sporadic variable decelerations. On vaginal examination, her cervix was noted at 7 cm, right occiput transverse, -1 station, with adequate contractions coming every 3 minutes. Regional anesthesia was requested.

After dosing of regional anesthesia, the patient was placed in supine position with a leftward tilt. The FHR and uterine monitors were adjusted when suddenly FHR dropped to 60 beats per minute below baseline. Oxygen via face mask and position change were initiated, but the FHR remained depressed for 120 seconds without signs of returning to baseline. Upon vaginal examination, the obstetric provider diagnosed umbilical cord prolapse and called for an emergency cesarean delivery for fetal bradycardia. The infant was born 10 minutes after the cesarean was called with Apgar scores of 4 (1 minute) and 9 (5 minutes). Umbilical cord gases showed mixed acidosis with an arterial pH of 7.0 and base excess of -12. Uterine atony was noted after delivery of the placenta, which quickly responded to oxytocin bolus and uterine massage with a quantitated blood loss (QBL) of 1200 ml. The patient was hemodynamically stable when transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) with intravenous fluid running at 125 ml/hour, and vital signs to be checked every 15 minutes, according to protocol.

Through the first 90 minutes in the PACU, the uterine fundus remained moderately firm. Vital signs showed systolic blood pressure around 90 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-70, pulse 110-120/min, respiratory rate 24-28/min. The patient was deemed stable. All monitor alarm functions were silenced to help the patient rest until a bed became available on the maternity floor. After 180 minutes in the PACU, the patient’s nurse discovered her unresponsive and the bedsheets were blood-soaked. The obstetrician and anesthesiologist were summoned and responded quickly. At that time, the patient’s vital signs showed a blood pressure of 88/40, mean arterial pressure of 57, pulse 142/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and 98% oxygen saturation. The intravenous fluid was opened up as a bolus. The uterus was boggy on examination. Uterotonic medications were ordered and administered. Quantitated blood loss was estimated at 1500 ml. A massive transfusion protocol was ordered. The patient remained hypotensive and tachycardic with continued vaginal bleeding, so the decision was made to return to the operating room for laparotomy and possible hysterectomy. Upon abdominal entry, the uterus was noted to be atonic despite uterotonic therapy. There was no other source of bleeding. Given the patient remained hemodynamically unstable, she underwent an emergency hysterectomy. As she continued to bleed after surgery, she had angiography and embolization of a small bleeding artery in the pelvis. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and required intubation and mechanical ventilation for two days. She made a complete recovery without any sequelae.

Title: To Dilute or Not Dilute: Drug Errors and Consequences in the Operating Room

The Case:
A 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and macular degeneration presented for a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with an eye block. She had undergone a similar procedure 4 weeks earlier and tolerated it well. In the preoperative holding area, the anesthesia team took the patient’s history and performed a brief physical examination. The patient’s daughter accompanied her for support and help with translation. Nothing had changed in her physical status since her prior procedure. She was bit slow to reply to questions, but this finding was attributed to the language barrier, as she had no reported history of cognitive impairment. The procedure was discussed with the patient and her daughter, and they agreed to proceed with the same MAC anesthetic that she had received during her prior procedure.

This was one of many eye cases during a busy day at a large academic medical center. The anesthesia team consisted of an attending anesthesiologist and a resident from another specialty. At this academic center, eye cases under MAC are typically performed with an eye block by the surgeon after the anesthesiologist has administered some short-acting sedation, commonly with remifentanil. For this purpose, the pharmacy typically stocks 2 mL syringes with a prediluted mixture of remifentanil 50 mcg/mL in the "eye rooms." On this day, there was a shortage of premixed remifentanil. The only remifentanil available was a vial of 1 mg in powder form. The resident, who was unfamiliar with the process of drug dilution, assumed that this should be diluted into 2 mL to mimic the premade syringes, and mixed 1 mg of remifentanil powder into a syringe of 2 mL saline at a concentration of 500 mcg/mL.

The patient was brought into the operating room and monitors were applied. After the pre-induction briefing was completed, the patient received 1 mL of the remifentanil solution. Shortly thereafter, she became unresponsive, hypotensive, and apneic. After multiple attempts to stimulate her, an overhead code was called. The attending anesthesiologist verified with the resident that only 1 mL of Remifentanil had been administered, and checked the record to confirm that this dose had been well tolerated by the patient in the past. Vasoactive drugs were administered to recover the blood pressure and the patient was ventilated with an ambu-bag. A neurological exam confirmed that the pupils were equal and reactive, albeit pinpoint. The possibility of a stroke was discussed, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered “stat.” After approximately 30 minutes of resuscitation, the patient was hemodynamically stabilized, regained her respiratory function, and became increasingly responsive. She was transported to the recovery room in stable condition and examinations by the neurology and cardiology consultation teams were unremarkable.

Afterthe patient recovered, the case was reviewed. The process of dilution of the remifentanil was discovered to have yielded a 10-fold stronger concentration than anyone had realized at the time. Instead of 50 mcg, the patient had received 500 mcg of remifentanil, which explained the hypotension, apnea, and loss of consciousness.

Title: The Hidden Danger of Unseen Intravenous Catheters

The Case:
A 6-week-old infant underwent a craniotomy and excision of abnormal brain tissue for treatment of hemimegalencephaly and epilepsy.  The infant had no other congenital abnormalities and was pre-operatively assigned an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification level III, indicating a patient with severe systemic disease, due to the underlying brain malformation.1



General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, a halogenated inhalational anesthetic, after which the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated.  A right femoral central venous catheter and an arterial catheter were inserted.  A 22-gauge intravenous catheter was inserted into the external jugular vein.  Surgical drapes were then placed over this intravenous catheter, making the external jugular vein cannulation site difficult to monitor by both the neurosurgeon and the anesthesiologist.  During the surgical procedure, the neurosurgeon adjusted the patient’s head, displacing the external jugular intravenous catheter into the subcutaneous tissue.  The catheter’s dislodgment went unnoticed due to its position underneath the surgical drapes.



The patient experienced significant blood loss during the surgical procedure and became hemodynamically unstable.  Blood products and intravenous fluids were infused under pressure into the external jugular intravenous catheter rather than the femoral central venous catheter.  Despite these resuscitative efforts, the patient developed severe hypotension and, ultimately, pulseless electrical activity.  The surgical drapes were removed to facilitate chest compressions.  At this time, marked subcutaneous fluid extravasation was noted at the site of the external jugular intravenous catheter.  An emergency thoracotomy was performed but the patient could not be resuscitated and died in the operating room.

Title: Dangers of Missing an Epidural Abscess: Multiple Visits and Delayed Diagnosis with a Severely Negative Outcome

The Case:
A 44-year-old man with a recent history of interferon treatment for Hepatitis C infection and a remote history of cervical spine surgery requiring permanent spinal hardware presented to his primary care physician with complaints of new onset headache, photophobia, and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. On physical examination, his neck was tender, but he had no neurologic abnormalities. Laboratory testing showed only abnormal transaminases. He was sent home from the clinic with advice to take over-the-counter analgesics.

Three days later, he presented to the emergency department (ED) with worsened headache and neck pain and was discharged without imaging or evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). He returned to his primary care physician four days later with worsening headache, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia, and was given oxycodone for pain. He was next seen in the hospital's urgent care clinic where he had a fever of 101.4˚F, hallucinations, and neck stiffness. He was sent to the ED by ambulance for suspected meningitis. CSF obtained by lumbar puncture was cloudy with 692 white blood cells per microliter (80% neutrophils), low glucose, and high protein, but no visible organisms on Gram staining. Cultures of blood and CSF were obtained but imaging of the cervical spine was not ordered. He was diagnosed with viral meningitis and sent home with antiemetics and long-acting oral morphine sulfate. He was not treated with antibiotics. The next morning, two blood cultures returned positive forStaphylococcus aureuswhile CSF culture was negative. After being called at home, the patient returned to the hospital and was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of Staphylococcal meningitis.

Despite initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient developed worsening neurologic symptoms on his third hospital day including weakness, urinary incontinence, and urinary retention. He was unable to stand or walk. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a spinal epidural abscess (SEA) adjacent to his surgical hardware. At that point, he was transferred to a tertiary care center where decompressive surgery was performed. Despite surgical intervention, the patient remained quadriplegic. He was unable to resume employment and required full-time home care after discharge. The patient committed suicide several years later.

================================================================================

Title: Lost in Transitions of Care: Managing an Opioid-Dependent Patient with Frequent Hospitalizations

The Case:
A middle-aged Black woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sickle cell crisis and a history of multiple, long admissions related to her sickle cell disease, including avascular necrosis of the hip. In the previous 365 days, she had spent 199 days hospitalized (54% of the year) at one hospital. The following paragraphs summarize her course over this previous year. Of note, oral morphine milligram-equivalents (OME) in this case are calculated using the institutions’ opioid equianalgesic doses. During these prior hospitalizations, her long-acting opioid requirements ranged from 120 to 300 OME.

Encounter 1

After a several-months-long hospitalization approximately one year ago, the patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for post-acute care on long-acting oral morphine sulfate extended release (ER) 120 mg twice daily (240 OME). She was released from the SNF after about one month, but on follow-up with her primary care physician about two weeks later, there was uncertainty about her opioid dosing, apparently because of incomplete records from her multiple sites of care. For unclear reasons, the physician did not access the state’s prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) but instead referred her to clinical pharmacy for medication support. After this consultation, the patient was started on transdermal extended-release buprenorphine 5 mcg/hour (possibly ~11-63 OME).

The tables below show what the pharmacist and prescriber(s) saw, or would have seen, in the PDMP at key transition times. For each controlled substance prescription, the PDMP shows the date filled, the drug name and formulation, the quantity dispensed, and the number of days that quantity would be expected to last according to the instructions given.

Table 1.Patient’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) entries through SNF stay and subsequent outpatient visits:

Note: all dates have been altered but reflect the actual duration between fill dates

Encounter 2

Shortly after this primary care visit, the patient was readmitted for about two weeks with increased pain. She received oxycodone at 180-240 OME during this hospital stay and was discharged with instructions to take oxycodone 40 mg ER three times daily (180 OME), according to the discharge summary. However, her actual discharge prescription, which was not mentioned on the discharge summary, was for oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg 1-2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed (45-90 OME), as oxycodone ER needed prior authorization and was not covered by her insurance. Ultimately, the oxycodone ER prescription was never filled.

Encounter 3

The patient was readmitted to the hospital several weeks later for increasing pain and was restarted on her previous inpatient regimen with oxycodone ER at 40 mg three times daily (180 OME). Within several days after admission, her pain was improved, but the pain pharmacy consultant noted that her self-reported home usage was only “possibly 23 OME,” and as a result, they recommended tapering the oxycodone dose by 50% every 3 days. The patient's pain worsened within several days, and therefore her oxycodone ER was titrated back up to 40 mg three times daily, but continuing severe pain led to further up-titration to 60 mg three times daily (270 OME). Her 2-month hospital stay was complicated by severe hip pain due to avascular necrosis, which eventually required total hip arthroplasty. After routine postoperative recovery, she was discharged on oxycodone ER 80 mg three times daily (360 OME); but because this medication was still not covered by her insurance plan, the care team requested the hospital to cover a 30-day supply to avoid delaying discharge.

Table 2.New additions to PDMP since encounter 2 through discharge from encounter 3

Note: all dates have been altered but reflect the actual duration between fill dates

Encounter 4

On follow-up with the primary care physician 4 weeks later, the patient was put back on long-acting oral morphine sulfate ER at 90 mg three times daily (270 OME, in addition to short-acting oxycodone/acetaminophen at 90 OME; see table 3 below) with plans to taper the dose. Prescriptions were sent to her pharmacy for a 7-day supply for 30 mg and 60 mg tablets of morphine sulfate ER with instructions to take one of each, for a total of 90 mg, three times daily. The outpatient pharmacy insisted on clarification of these instructions, so only 30 mg tablets were initially dispensed. Five days later, the 60 mg tablet prescription was filled. In the meantime, the patient’s opioid dose gap was “covered” with oxycodone/acetaminophen.

Table 3.New additions to PDMP since encounter 3 and after follow-up from encounter 4

Note: all dates have been altered but reflect the actual duration between fill dates

Encounter 5

About 1.5 weeks after the last morphine sulfate ER fill shown in Table 3 above, the patient was readmitted for abdominal pain secondary to sickle cell pain crisis. She was started on morphine sulfate ER 60 mg twice daily (120 OME) but required up-titration to 120 mg twice daily (240 OME). The Pain pharmacy consultant recommended conversion to methadone, so she was discharged with a prescription for methadone 10 mg tablets and directions to take three-quarters of a tablet three times daily (roughly 113-180 OME). The outpatient pharmacy wanted clarification of the prescription, but had difficulties reaching the care team, so the prescription was not filled. Several days later, the pharmacy received a fax request to deactivate the prescription; therefore, the patient never received methadone.

Encounter 6

The patient was re-admitted 2 weeks later with worsening pain. She was placed on morphine sulfate ER 60 mg twice daily (120 OME). Medication reconciliation by a pharmacy technician documented only the delayed fill of morphine sulfate ER 60 mg three times daily on July 22 (180 OME) and missed the fact that her prescribed dose was 270 OME. On discharge, the patient was instructed to continue morphine sulfate ER 60 mg three times daily, but she was only prescribed immediate-release oxycodone for 3 days at 180 OME. They failed to notice in the PDMP that her most recently filled long-acting opioid prescription was for morphine sulfate ER 90 mg three times daily (7-day supply) 2 months prior (see Table 3).

Three weeks later, the patient was re-admitted for worsening pain.

Title: Coming up for Err: Missed Diagnosis in a Patient with Recurrent Pneumothorax

The Case:


A 31-year-old woman with no past medical history presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with worsening shortness of breath. On examination and plain radiography, she was unexpectedly found to have a moderate-sized left pneumothorax. A thoracostomy tube was placed resulting in immediate relief of symptoms. The patient had a computed tomography (CT) scan done as a part of the work-up and she was told that she had some blebs and mild emphysema. Once the lung was fully expanded, the chest tube was removed and the patient was sent home with no specific follow-up instructions, except to see her primary care physician.



Three days later, the patient returned to the same ED with similar symptoms and again was found to have a left pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. At this time, another chest CT was obtained, and a pulmonology consultation was requested. The consulting physician explained to the patient that she had some small cysts and blebs in her chest. After this second episode of spontaneous pneumothorax, she was discharged to her home after the chest tube was removed.



Two weeks later, the patient was found on the floor of her kitchen by her husband with severe respiratory distress and a very thready pulse. He called 911. After hearing her recent history, paramedics immediately placed a needle in her left chest which gave prompt relief of symptoms and restored hemodynamic stability, strongly suggesting she had had another episode of left-sided pneumothorax with tamponade physiology (also known as a tension pneumothorax). She was taken to a different ED this time, where she had another chest CT. The ED physician was concerned by the CT scan and requested another pulmonary consultation. This time, the on-call pulmonary physician diagnosed cystic lung disease based on the CT findings, and decided to transfer the patient to an advanced lung center for further immediate work-up and treatment.



On arrival at the referral center, the patient had a left-sided chest tube in place with no air leak and a fully expanded lung. The patient’s CT scan showed classic features of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare cystic lung disease that is most often seen in young women.



After careful evaluation, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis on the left side. At the same time, a biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. After surgery, the patient required about 2 liters/minute of oxygen by nasal cannula to prevent dyspnea and hypoxia with exertion. She was started on sirolimus to prevent progression of her bilateral extensive cystic disease, and she is now doing well, with no recurrences of pneumothorax, and being followed regularly through a comprehensive Advanced Lung Disease and Lung Transplant program.

Title: Sudden Collapse During Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: Expect the Unexpected

The Case:
A seven-year-old girl had esophageal stenosis due to ingestion of a caustic substance as an infant(Note: although not specified in this case, the most common caustic substances ingested by children are household cleaning agents). She required recurrent upper endoscopy with esophageal dilation under general anesthesia. During the procedure, she was fully monitored with a continuous arterial oxygen saturation probe, heart rate monitors, two-lead electrocardiography, continuous capnography,and non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurements.



The attending gastroenterologist and endoscopist were serially dilating the esophagus with larger and larger rigid dilators when the patient suddenly developed hypotension with a marked decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2). She was immediately given a fluid bolus, phenylephrine, and 100% oxygen but still developed cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated with cardiac massage,but she could not be resuscitated and died.

Title: Local Anesthesia-Induced Coma During Total Knee Arthroplasty.

The Case:
A 61-year-old male patient weighing 57 kg (126 lbs), with severe knee osteoarthritis and hypertension, was admitted for right total knee replacement under subarachnoid regional anesthesia.



The anesthesiologist performed a right femoral nerve block with 20 ml (100 mg) of 0.5% racemic bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia. Intraoperatively, the surgeon also infiltrated the arthroplasty wound with 200 mg of 0.5% ropivacaine, unaware that the anesthesiologist had already performed a femoral nerve block. The patient was sedated with an infusion of propofol throughout the procedure. To the surprise of the anesthesiologist, 100 mcg boluses of intravenous phenylephrine were required to maintain the patient’s arterial blood pressure intraoperatively. At the end of the procedure, after stopping the propofol infusion, the patient remained unresponsive.



When the anesthesiologist inquired about the surgeon’s use of local anesthesia, it was discovered that the surgeon had used a relatively large dose of ropivacaine. After diagnosing the patient with Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST), the anesthesiologist ordered an intravenous bolus and infusion of intralipid. The patient was observed in the surgical intensive care overnight. He recovered without further complications and was transferred to the surgical ward on the first postoperative day.

Title: The Consequences of Miscommunication Regarding a Possible Artifact

The Case:
A 52-year-old man complaining of intermittent left shoulder pain for several years presented to an orthopedic surgeon’s office. He was diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury and underwent left shoulder surgery. The postoperative course was unremarkable. Four months later, the orthopedic surgeon ordered a routine follow-up X-ray of the left shoulder. The radiologist interpreted the film as a normal left shoulder radiograph but noted a “… soft tissue density in the left suprahilar region most probably artifact, however follow-up chest X-ray is advised for further evaluation.” This report along with the images were sent to the orthopedic surgeon’s office the same day. However, the orthopedic surgeon independently read and interpreted the same images as “slight loss of rotator cuff interval added to decompression of AC joint and undersurface of the acromion noted.'' The surgeon did not mention any soft tissue density, did not reference the radiologist’s report, and did not order any follow-up study.

The patient saw the orthopedic surgeon multiple times after the initial follow-up X-ray without any knowledge of or follow-up for the “soft tissue density” in the left suprahilar region. Several months later, the patient’s primary care provider noted the radiologist’s finding during a routine visit for healthcare maintenance, and ordered a proper workup. Following needle biopsy guided by computed tomography, the lung mass was diagnosed as a Stage IIB adenocarcinoma with metastasis to one of ten parabronchial nodes. This diagnosis was quickly followed by surgical resection and several courses of chemotherapy. Upon review of the images, the mass had grown from an initial diameter of 3.5 cm to 7.0 cm just before resection.

Title: Inadequate Anesthesia Preparation Leading to Difficult Intubation and Severe Hypoxemia

The Case:
A 34-year-old morbidly obese man weighing 178 kg (392 pounds) was admitted for incision and drainage of a pilonidal abscess with fistulectomy under general anesthesia. He reported no major medical problems and no history of snoring. Upon initial evaluation by an anesthesiologist, he was found to have a short thick neck and a Mallampati score of 3, suggesting that endotracheal intubation might be difficult.



The patient was positioned supine with his head and neck in the ramped position plus sniffing position for endotracheal intubation. A high flow nasal cannula was used for preoxygenation and to help avoid precipitous desaturation in the event of difficulty intubating the trachea. A fellow anesthetist suggested that video-laryngoscopy equipment should be brought into the operating room, but the anesthesiologist assigned to the case rejected the suggestion. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol and fentanyl, while neuromuscular block was obtained with intravenous suxamethonium. A first-year resident attempted to intubate the patient but failed. The attending anesthesiologist took over, but before intubation could be performed, the patient started to cough and desaturated to 40-50%. The anesthesiologist gave the patient rocuronium and sevoflurane, but he still could not intubate the patient and failed with a glide scope. He then gave 12 mg/kg of intravenous sugammadex to reverse the neuromuscular block. After about two minutes, the patient started to cough up bloody secretions and was administered 100% oxygen by mask. His arterial saturation increased rapidly to 100%.



Although the patient's saturation was less than 80-88% for at least 10 minutes, he suffered no apparent neurological sequelae. After a period of recovery, he was brought back to the operating room for the originally scheduled procedure, which was completed without further complications.



================================================================================

Title: Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia Masquerading as Panic Attacks

The Case:


At the age of 16, an otherwise healthy woman began feeling “woozy” after her high school gym classes. She described it as “not a black-out but a feeling of a white-out” occurring roughly once every month or two. Her symptoms were abrupt in onset and she felt her heart was racing and pounding like it was going to jump out of her chest. The symptoms lasted between 5 and 15 minutes, and then subsided after sitting down. There was no family history of heart disease. Over the ensuing years, similar episodes occurred occasionally, usually related to stress, such as while giving presentations to large audiences.



When the patient was in her 30’s, she went through a period of significant emotional and financial stress, having just broken up with her longtime boyfriend, and suffered some loss of income.  At a time when she was feeling particularly stressed, she experienced a more severe episode that she described as “her heart pounding.”  She went to a local emergency department (ED) thinking she might be having “a heart attack.” She had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and was discharged with a diagnosis of “likely stress reaction/possible panic attack.” She felt embarrassed for having gone to the ED and although she continued to periodically have these symptoms, she did not mention them to anyone. Two years later, the symptoms occurred while on a bicycle ride, requiring her to dismount and sit on the side of the road for 45 minutes until the symptoms subsided. After this attack, she scheduled a primary care appointment.



After taking her social history, the physician suggested that she see a psychiatrist for presumed panic attacks. Based on her internet reading, she asked if this could be a heart rhythm problem. The physician reluctantly ordered a 24-hour Holter monitor, which came back “normal,” although she did not have any symptoms while wearing the monitor.



At the age of 40, the patient had another severe episode during which she felt a twinge of chest pain, and again went to an ED. The ECG was normal and she was referred for a cardiac exercise treadmill test, which was normal for the first 8 minutes. However, at 9 minutes, she began to experience one of her “woozy” spells and the ECG showed a regular heart rate of 230 beats per minute with narrow QRS complexes. She was relieved to be “finally diagnosed” as having paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) after more than two decades of experiencing these symptoms.



================================================================================

Title: An Inadvertent Bolus of Norepinephrine.

The Case:
A 64-year-old woman with a history of anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, arthritis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, an ascending aortic aneurysm, and a bicuspid aortic valve, presented to clinic with several months of worsening dyspnea on exertion. An echocardiogram showed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. She then underwent surgery for an aortic valve replacement, ligation of her left atrial appendage, and repair of her ascending aortic aneurysm.

Following surgery, the patient experienced intermittent episodes of hypotension, for which she was given intravenous (IV) fluid boluses and vasopressor support. She received IV norepinephrine at a rate of 0.5 - 6 mcg/minute until 21:00 on postoperative day 1. At 08:00 on postoperative day 2, the patient’s blood pressure was 98/59 mmHg and a 250 mL fluid bolus was ordered. The fluid bag was attached to the IV line that had the vasopressor at a Y-site and the bolus was initiated. The patient developed diaphoresis, tachycardia to 114 bpm, and hypertension with an apex value of 271/161 mmHg. Once the inadvertent bolus was recognized, the vasopressor infusion was immediately stopped. In total, the patient received approximately 4.5 mL (or 160 micrograms) of norepinephrine infused over 15 minutes.

The patient was then closely monitored, and her hemodynamic parameters returned to baseline approximately 15 minutes later. However, the patient had ongoing hypotension in the hours following the inadvertent bolus of norepinephrine with a nadir of 54/38 mmHg, again requiring vasopressor administration and additional fluid boluses. The next day, the patient's blood pressure stabilized, and she was transferred to a stepdown unit, and later discharged home.

While the incident caused only temporary and minor harm to the patient, it was a cause of significant stress and anxiety throughout the rest of her hospital stay and persisted after her discharge. Under different circumstances, this error could have resulted in significant harm, including neurologic impairment and death.

================================================================================

Title: Norepinephrine Dosing Error Associated with Multiple Health System Vulnerabilities

The Case:
A 65-year-old man presented to a Level III trauma center with bilateral lower extremity paralysis following a ground level fall. His past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was then transferred to a Level I trauma center that could provide a higher level of care following an incidental finding of a 9-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm and cervical spinal cord injury. Post transfer, the patient was noted to have rapidly progressive ascending paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe spinal stenosis involving C3-4 and post-traumatic cord edema/contusion involving C6-7. A continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of norepinephrine was initiated to maintain adequate spinal cord perfusion, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of greater than 85 mmHg (also known as “MAP therapy”).

Norepinephrine was incorrectly programmed into the infusion pump for a weight-based dose of 0.5 mcg/kg/min rather than the ordered dose of 0.5 mcg/min, resulting in a dose that was 70 times greater than intended. The patient became hemodynamically unstable, alternating between hypertensive urgency and hypotension. On four separate occasions, MAP increased by more than 80 mmHg immediately after restarting the infusion. He then experienced sudden cardiac arrest and was emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to rule out acute coronary occlusion. Following a percutaneous cardiac procedure, the patient experienced bradycardia and cardiac arrest within 9 hours of admission to the hospital. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated but failed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation.

================================================================================

Title: Hyponatremia Secondary to Home Parenteral Nutrition Error

The Case:
A 4-year-old (former 33-week premature) boy with a complex medical history including gastroschisis and subsequent volvulus in infancy resulting in short bowel syndrome, central venous catheter placement, and home parenteral nutrition (PN) dependence was admitted with hyponatremia (serum sodium 126 mmol/L) identified on routine outpatient laboratory screening. He had no clinical changes that would have predisposed him to electrolyte abnormalities: no reported changes in stool output, emesis, adjustments to his enteral feeding regimen, medication changes, or recent infections at the time of hospital admission.



Sodium levels normalized within 24 hours of initiating compounded IV fluids with similar dextrose and electrolyte content as the home PN solution. A pharmacist from the home infusion pharmacy notified the physician that an error in home PN mixing had been identified with omission of sodium acetate for several weeks prior to admission. Upon further review, it was discovered a new file had been created for this chronic PN patient by the home infusion pharmacy; the PN formula in this file was transcribed erroneously without sodium acetate by one of the home infusion center pharmacists. This error resulted in only 20% of the patient’s prescribed sodium being mixed into the home PN solution for several weeks, resulting in hyponatremia and unnecessary hospital admission. Previously written parenteral nutrition orders were reviewed by the physician and dietitian; the sodium acetate and other macronutrient and micronutrient components were confirmed as correct by the ordering physician and home infusion pharmacist. The patient returned home on a proper PN regimen, less than 48 hours after admission.



================================================================================

Title: Two Cases of Retained Vaginal Packing: When Writing an Order is Not Enough

The Case:
Case #1:

A patient underwent an open reconstructive urogynecologic procedure. A Foley catheter was placed to drain the bladder and lap pads were used during the operation. After completion of the procedure, the physician composed a dressing by cutting a vaginal packing sponge (which removed the radiopaque marker attached to the end of the sponge), coated it with estrogen cream and placed it in the vagina. Then 4x4 gauze dressings, a Kerlix™ fluff and a peri-pad were put on the perineum and secured with mesh pants. The nurse documented the surgical counts as correct and “vag pack with Premarin®cream by doctor, gauze 4x4’s” was recorded as the dressing. The physician order was to remove the pack the next day when the Foley catheter was removed. The patient went to a medical floor postoperatively because no beds were available on the surgical ward. The next day, the ward nurse read the physician’s order to remove the Foley and the packing. The nurse removed the Foley catheter and the 4x4’s, the Kerlix™ fluff and the peri-pad, assuming this was the packing. Before discharge, the physician stopped by to see the patient, looked briefly at her perineum and did not see anything. The physician asked the patient if “everything” had been removed. The patient said “yes” and was discharged to be seen in the office for follow-up.



Ten days later the patient had a feeling of vaginal irritation and fullness and had burning with urination. When she was seen in the office, the physician told her she had a urinary tract infection and placed her on antibiotics. She developed a very malodorous vaginal discharge and would not go out of the house because she was so embarrassed by the persistent odor. Three weeks after the procedure, the patient went to the Emergency Department (ED) with a fever and pelvic fullness, feeling like something was “inside of her”, and pain when sitting. Acomputerized tomography(CT) scan showed an amorphous density high in the vagina without evidence of perforation or abscess. A gynecology consultation was obtained, whereupon the physician removed a rust-colored, fetid, retained vaginal pack. Risk management was notified, and a disclosure discussion was held with the patient.



Case #2:

A patient underwent an anterior/posterior urogynecologic procedure. A Foley catheter was placed to drain the bladder and surgical sponges were used during the operation. After the procedure, the physician placed radiopaque vaginal packing in the vagina and a dressing on the perineum. In the nursing intraoperative record, the operating room (OR) nurse documented the surgical counts as correct and documented that an x-ray detectable pack was in the vagina and a Kerlix™ dressing was on the skin. The OR nurse did not complete the Orifice Packing Communication Tool nor did she place the colored armband with the words “remove packing before discharge” on the patient, as specified in the Orifice Packing Policy. The OR nurse could not find these materials, so she wrote “vaginal packing” on a slip of paper, which she put on the gurney mattress to which the patient was then transferred.



At the handoff to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurse, the OR nurse stated that there was packing in the vagina but did not ask for nor receive any repeat-back confirmation. The physician wrote an order to remove the vaginal packing when the Foley catheter was removed before discharge. Hours later in the PACU, a different nurse removed the Foley but did not see any vaginal packing and thus sought help from another nurse. The other nurse looked to see if the patient was wearing the colored armband and not seeing one, assumed there was no packing but did not actually examine the patient. The physician came by to see the patient just before discharge and asked the patient, using the patient’s daughter to translate, if the Foley and packing had been removed. The patient said that, yes, “it” had been, and she was then discharged.



Two days later, the patient called the hospital and spoke with a patient safety officer speaking her native language. The patient said that while she was sitting on the toilet, she felt fullness and burning “down there” and saw something dangling out from inside her. She painfully pulled out a 3-foot-long piece of cotton gauze with a blue line in it. She asked the patient safety officer if that was a Foley and wanted to know why it was inside her. The physician was notified, and a disclosure discussion was held with the patient.



================================================================================

Title: A Postpartum Woman with an Erroneous SARS-CoV-2 Test

The Case:


A full-term pregnant patient was admitted in March 2020 for a scheduled Cesarean delivery, before being tested according to a universal inpatient screening protocol for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). During surgery, the patient developed a fever and required oxygen supplementation. The facility implemented contact and droplet isolation precautions due to suspicion for COVID-19. The patient was transferred to a negative pressure room, the baby was isolated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the patient’s husband was instructed to self-isolate at home until the SARS-CoV-2 test results were available.



A specimen obtained via nasopharyngeal swab was sent to a commercial laboratory for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, due to delays in receiving those results, another sample was tested two days later with a newly developed in-house test and a third sample was sent to the state public health laboratory. The in-house test returned as positive for SARS-CoV-2. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth, and a chest radiograph was unremarkable.



When the patient left the hospital on her fourth postpartum day, she was in stable clinical condition. She reported feeling well, without cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Because she was assumed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, but clinically healthy, she was advised to isolate herself at home for 14 days, and the hospital initiated contact tracing of all exposed persons, in consultation with the local public health department. In addition, because she had a newborn and a toddler at home, she was encouraged to be vigilant about wearing a mask, to stay in one room of the house if possible, and to focus on hand hygiene and surface cleaning.



Two days after the mother’s discharge, the commercial and state lab tests were both reported as negative. The patient was concerned about SARS-CoV-2 transmission, so she chose to bottle-feed rather than breastfeed, despite her pediatrician’s encouragement to breastfeed. An infant hearing test was deferred as the tester did not want to risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, the patient and her baby did well clinically, although the false positive result caused substantial anxiety and alterations in home care (personal and parental) and health care during the critical transitional period of caring for a newborn child. The patient and her family were extremely forgiving of the error, appreciating the uncertainties related to the pandemic and the care and communication from health care staff.



A thorough root-cause analysis subsequently determined that the positive test run on the in-house platform was due to cross-contamination from a neighboring positive sample. A follow-up test conducted on a remnant sample from the in-house assay, one week later, confirmed that the patient was negative. When it was determined that the in-house test was falsely positive, testing was shifted to other commercial platforms and to a second-generation in-house test. Since that time, more than 50,000 tests have been run, and there have been no other known cases of false positive tests due to cross-contamination

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Diagnosis in the Setting of Virtual Care: Remembering the Physical Examination

The Case:


A 71-year-old frail, non-ambulatory woman a with history of multiple sclerosis and neurogenic bladder presented to the emergency department (ED) of an academic medical center with fever of two days duration, sweating, and dry cough. Labs showed leukocytosis (up to 11,100 cells per µL) and hyponatremia (128 mmol/L). She was admitted for work-up including a COVID-19 test, viral panel, urinalysis, and blood cultures – all of which were negative. She was deemed high-risk for COVID-19, but a second test was also negative. No source of infection was found, and she was discharged after three days. Neither the ED staff nor the internal medicine team documented any rectal or genital examinations, and no additional testing or imaging was performed after the infectious disease evaluation remained negative.



The next day, her husband called her primary care office because she was feeling worse with rapid breathing, sweating, and diarrhea. During a video visit that afternoon, the symptoms were attributed to viral illness. The physician also noted that the patient described a skin breakdown on her “backside,” but the affected area was not visualized by the physician. The plan was for a home health nurse to evaluate the skin breakdown later in the week.



Thirty-six hours later, she was brought to the hospital via ambulance due to her husband’s concern about her altered mental status. On arrival, she was in septic shock with systolic blood pressure in the 80’s. The physical examination triggered concern about a necrotizing soft tissue infection. In the operating room, a necrotizing infection that tracked from a perirectal horseshoe abscess, through the perineum, up onto the anterior abdominal wall was found. She underwent an extensive debridement. After further discussion with her family, she was transitioned to comfort care in alignment with her goals. She died the day after surgery.

================================================================================

Title: The Impact of Communication on Medication Errors

The Case:


A 93-year-old man with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and with a ventricular assist device (VAD) had been on warfarin for his VAD and for stroke prevention for his atrial fibrillation. He had been followed by an anticoagulation clinic at his local hospital for several years. He was admitted to the hospital after being referred by the VAD team for an elevated internal normalized ratio (INR) of 13.4. During medication review, the hospital team discovered that he was prescribed warfarin 4 mg daily on Mondays and Fridays and 3 mg daily on all other days of the week. The patient had multiple outpatient visits prior to his hospital admission at which both 1 mg and 5 mg strengths of warfarin were noted as active on his medication list. After discussions with the patient’s family, it was determined that the patient’s daughter had given the patient three 5 mg tablets of warfarin (total daily dose 15 mg) for two days in a row instead of three 1 mg tablets (total daily dose 3 mg). The patient received a daily dose of warfarin five times that of the intended dose. The patient did not experience any signs or symptoms of bleeding and was discharged the next day after a vitamin K infusion.



================================================================================

Title: Delay in Appropriate Diagnosis and Treatment Leading to Death from Pulmonary Embolism

The Case:
A 56-year-old woman with a history of mild, persistent asthma and recent Achilles tendon repair presented to the emergency department (ED) by ambulance for shortness of breath. Her symptoms, which developed over four hours and felt like prior asthma exacerbations, also included chest tightness that was relieved with Albuterol. Her vital signs in the ED were notable for a heart rate in the 90s and hypoxia requiring 2 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Physical examination revealed diffuse wheezing. A chest radiograph demonstrated mild pulmonary edema but no focal abnormalities. The emergency physician interpreted the electrocardiogram (ECG) as having ST depression in leads V2-V6, unchanged from a previous ECG, and new T-wave inversion in leads V2-V3.

The patient was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation. She initially responded to treatment with aggressive pulmonary toilet and bronchodilator therapy administered on a step-down unit. Eight hours after admission, her serum lactate rose to 4.7 mmol/L (normal < 2.0 mmol/L) and her oxygen requirement increased to 3-4 liters/minute. Although she did not have a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE) was considered based on her limited mobility secondary to recent orthopedic surgery. Given this history and her continued clinical decompensation, a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest was obtained. The radiologist’s summarized impression, communicated by telephone to the primary team 12 hours after admission, noted bilateral filling defects to the subsegmental level in all five lung lobes without right heart strain or saddle embolus. However, the written radiology impression was not reviewed, nor did the care team independently review the CT images. In fact, the radiologist’s full note mentioned “profound evidence of right heart strain.” This critical finding was not conveyed to the primary team and the lack of independent image verification led to miscalculation of disease severity. The patient was started on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).

On hospital day two, her serum lactate continued to rise and the rapid response team (RRT) responded for increasing tachycardia. She remained hemodynamically stable and did not appear to be in acute distress, so neither the RRT nor the primary team made changes to the care plan. However, the patient’s condition worsened that evening; she became hemodynamically unstable with hypotension and increasing tachycardia. She was transferred emergently to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. A bedside point of care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrated marked right heart strain. After arterial and central venous catheters were placed, she was given a reduced dose of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Approximately five minutes later, she developed acute signs of stroke. Seizure-like movements followed and her cardiac rhythm changed to pulseless electrical activity requiring closed chest compressions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.After return of spontaneous circulation, the patient was cannulated for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Ongoing resuscitation, including administration of vasopressor therapy, continued overnight. She ultimately transitioned to comfort care and died on hospital day three.

================================================================================

Title: Unintentional Ketamine Overdose in the Operating Room – Mixing Up the Ampules

The Case:
A 50-year-old man with a history of cancer and previous airway operations was admitted for a rigid direct laryngoscopy. The anesthesiologist trainee staffing the case was first-year oral maxillofacial surgical resident working in the operating room by himself. The consulting physician anesthesiologist prescribed the resident to administer ketamine to the patient as part of the general anesthesia protocol. The resident unintentionally located two vials of 100mg/mL ketamine instead of the intended 10mg/mL vials that are used routinely. The provider intended to administer 95mg of ketamine intravenously, but erroneously administered 950mg.  At the conclusion of the surgical case, the patient had delayed emergence from anesthesia. During assessment of the potential causes for this delayed emergence an empty vial of ketamine of the higher concentration of 100mg/ml was found. Based on this finding a provisional diagnosis of inadvertent ketamine overdose was made. The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit, where he was later extubated uneventfully. He was discharged home the following day.



================================================================================

Title: Delayed Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A False Sense of Security.

The Case:
A 60-year-old woman was seen for a routine visit by a physician assistant (PA) at a family medicine practice. A right breast mass was palpated and felt likely to be benign. However, the PA ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound examination. The radiologist reviewed the images, noting focal asymmetry in the right breast. The assessment was challenging due to dense breast tissue. Ultimately, the films were interpreted as “probably benign” findings (BI-RADS Category 3) and follow-up imaging at 6 months was recommended to ensure stability. The report noted that a biopsy should not be delayed if a “suspicious mass” is present on physical exam. Reassured by the report, the PA did not order a biopsy or refer the patient to a breast surgeon.

When the patient returned 5 months later for a follow-up appointment, the mass was found to have increased in size. She was referred to a surgeon for a biopsy, but there was confusion about whether the patient herself was to schedule the appointment or whether the surgeon’s office would contact her. After an 8-week delay, the patient contacted the family medicine office. The PA was surprised that she had not yet seen the surgeon and arranged for an urgent surgical appointment and biopsy of the enlarging right breast mass. The biopsy showed invasive breast cancer, which, now 7 months after the initial presentation, was found to be metastatic to the axillary nodes and spine. It is unknown if an earlier diagnosis would have affected the outcome of this aggressive malignancy.

================================================================================

Title: Premature Closure: Was It Just Syncope?

The Case:
A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of syncope. His partner reported he had been exercising when he became dizzy, passed out, then quickly regained consciousness. His initial vital signs in the ED were notable for a systolic blood pressure in the 100s and a heart rate of 56 beats per minute. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ST segment and T wave changes but not ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was ordered and performed, but it is unclear whether the ordering physician ever reviewed the CT images.

Concerned for a cardiac etiology of syncope, the emergency physician administered aspirin, started the patient on an unfractionated heparin drip, and ordered an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function. However, the patient reported he felt well and wanted to pursue an outpatient workup. As an alternative to admission, the physician discussed the case with a cardiologist who recommended full-dose, therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) and cardiology follow up the next day.

While awaiting the echocardiogram, the patient became somnolent and his heart rate slowed. The emergency physician placed a transcutaneous pacemaker, intubated the patient, and ordered a full-body CT scan which demonstrated a large subdural hematoma with mass effect on the brain and surrounding cerebral edema. In the operating theater, a neurosurgeon performed an emergent craniotomy and placed an external ventricular drain. The patient’s condition temporarily improved. However, serial brain imaging demonstrated expansion of the intracranial hemorrhage and ultimately brainstem herniation. He transitioned to comfort care and later died.

A post-mortem review of the patient’s medical records indicated he had multiple ED visits with similar episodes of syncope in the preceding months all resulting in falls and head trauma. It was later acknowledged that the first CT scan of the patient’s brain showed a small subdural hematoma that was not recognized by his clinical team. Ultimately, the initial ECG changes were retrospectively interpreted as consistent with intracranial hemorrhage.

================================================================================

Title: Lack of Sepsis Recognition Leads to Delay in Care Following Cesarean Delivery.

The Case:
A 26-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and gestational hypertension was admitted to the hospital for induction of labor at 36 weeks due to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. The induction failed and the resulting cesarean delivery was complicated by significant postpartum hemorrhage. The infant was taken to the neonatal ICU (NICU) for sepsis evaluation. Approximately 8 hours after birth, the infant was found to have extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli bacteremia and sepsis.

On the morning of the first post-operative day, the patient was noted to be dizzy and hypotensive and complained of severe perineal and abdominal pain. The obstetric team attributed the perineal pain to prolonged efforts to push during labor and offered symptomatic relief with cold packs and Benzocaine spray. They were more concerned about the hypotension, which was thought to be due to hypovolemia from peri-operative blood loss.

A SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) alert occurred later in the afternoon due to hypotension. Laboratory tests showed markedly elevated lactic acid (6.3), leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The patient was given antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and blood. The unit nurses had significant concerns about the patient’s status in the morning of the first postoperative day but were unable to get the physicians to intervene until the SIRS alert, and even then, the physicians were skeptical of the both the alert and the laboratory results. The physicians felt that they were adequately addressing the patient’s problems, whereas the nurses did not feel that their concerns were being taken seriously. An Endocrinology consultation was obtained due to a suspicion for adrenal crisis associated with chronic steroid use. The patient was booked for an urgent exploratory laparotomy due to persisting concerns about postoperative blood loss. However, she stabilized after fluid resuscitation and a computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained instead. The CT scan showed no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding, and therefore the laparotomy was cancelled.

After the CT scan, the patient went to the postpartum unit instead of the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to miscommunication. Several hours later with persistent hypotension, she was transferred to the MICU where she was treated for putative adrenal crisis, hypotension, and septic shock.  She was noted by the ICU physicians to have severe abdominal and perineal pain and was visibly ill. She had developed new ecchymoses of both flanks extending to the vulvar labia that were exquisitely tender in association with neutropenia and hypotension. The possibility of necrotizing soft tissue infection was considered.

Urgent consultations were obtained from Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Acute Care Surgery. They took her to the operating room (OR) together for suspected necrotizing fasciitis. The Pfannenstiel incision was opened and counter-incisions of the bilateral flanks and labia were performed. The tissues were found to be dusky, but necrosis was not found. She returned to the surgical ICU for fluid resuscitation. Later that day, the patient deteriorated and failed to respond to resuscitation. She was urgently taken back to the OR, where she was found to have necrotizing soft tissue infection, including in the flanks, labia, and uterus. She underwent a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and extensive resection of soft tissue including fascia and muscle. Her subsequent, lengthy hospitalization was notable for multiple wound debridements, rehabilitation, and skin grafts. Her son required antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis in the NICU.

Title: Preventing Complications during Aneurysm Clipping – the Role of Neuromonitoring.

The Case:
A 73-year-old female patient was transferred from an outside hospital to a tertiary center with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm.  At approximately 1000 on the date of transfer, the patient was scheduled for right frontotemporal craniotomy and aneurysm clipping with neuromonitoring to start at 1930.  Neuromonitoring was included on the booking slip, and the neurosurgery resident called the Operating Room (OR) front desk to confirm.  The attending neurosurgeon was not present for the huddle but arrived for positioning of the patient and realized that the neuromonitoring technician was not present.  The OR front desk stated that neuromonitoring had not been called, but the attending surgeon decided to proceed with the procedure.  No problems were identified during surgery, but the patient emerged from anesthesia with left-sided paralysis, and post-op imaging showed evidence of a new stroke.  Postoperative morbidity and mortality review suggested that this stroke may have been prevented if neuromonitoring had been performed during the surgery.

================================================================================

Title: Multiple Levels Involved in Prescribing the Wrong Medication

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman complained of some ongoing nausea two weeks after hernia repair surgery. The surgery itself had not been complicated and on her postoperative visit, her physical examination was benign. The only lab abnormality was a mild increase in her liver function tests which was attributed to her ongoing nausea and vomiting. The patient was encouraged to maintain her hydration status and to trial small frequent meals as conservative management of her nausea and vomiting.

On postoperative day 15, she called back again with ongoing nausea. She was asked to stop taking the pain medication (oxycodone) and given a prescription for trimethobenzamide (after noting her allergy to ondansetron) to be taken every 6 hours as needed for nausea. The patient filled her prescription the same day and started using the medication that same evening. The next day her nausea was worse, and she continued taking the medication, thinking that the drug would take time to work. That evening she was more tired, having had several episodes of vomiting. The next day her daughter found her extremely weak and took her to the Emergency Department (ED).

On arrival to the ED, the patient was profoundly volume depleted, confused, and had electrolyte abnormalities. On review of her medications, she was asked why she was taking topiramate; the daughter recalled her mother picking up a new medication for nausea two days prior. Once adequately volume-supported, the patient was able to answer all questions well and recalled starting the new medication two days ago. Further questioning revealed that the new medication was topiramate (Topamax™) instead of trimethobenzamide (Tigan™). Topamax™ had been accidentally selected by a nurse and pended to the physician who then prescribed the medication electronically to the patient for her ongoing symptom of nausea. The medication was then picked up by the patient from her usual pharmacy. The pharmacist had reviewed the medication with the patient, but with her state of mind she did not question the information being provided. Although no major complications occurred in this case, it is an example of how mistakes are made, despite multiple opportunities for cross-verification.

Title: When the Meds Don’t Reach the Bed

The Case:


A 69-year-old man with cognitive impairment and marginal housing was admitted for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Over the course of a four-day admission, his condition moderately improved with bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. The medical team planned to discharge the patient to his residential care home on a weekend day with conventional treatments for COPD exacerbations including doxycycline and prednisone along with control inhalers budesonide-formoterol and tiotropium, and nebulized albuterol for rescue.



The clinician caring for the patient scheduled transport for 4:00 pm and arranged for Meds-to-Beds (M2B), a service available in some hospitals to have a local retail pharmacy deliver medications to the bedside prior to discharge. Given the patient’s inability to pay for the discharge medications, the social worker on the discharge planning team sent a voucher to cover the cost of medications to the commercial pharmacy around 11:00 am. The clinician later informed the nursing staff that he/she would personally pick up and deliver the medications due to concern about recent delays in M2B deliveries.



During the early afternoon, medication pick-up was delayed for several hours because the voucher amount sent by the social worker did not match the out-of-pocket cost of the medications. Around 3:30 pm, the social worker directly communicated with the pharmacy to resolve the voucher issue. However, the clinician was about to perform a high-risk procedure for another patient and no longer available to pick up the medications. Before performing the procedure, the clinician contacted the pharmacy with instructions to proceed with the medication delivery but did not communicate this change in plan to the patient’s nurse or social worker. Scheduled transport arrived at 4:00pm and the patient was discharged without his medications.

After the procedure was completed around 4:30 pm, the clinician was informed that the medication delivery still had not arrived due to limited weekend staffing at the pharmacy. The discharge medications were delivered to the hospital at 4:45 pm, after the patient had been discharged and therefore too late.



The patient was subsequently readmitted to the same hospital approximately five hours after discharge due to dyspnea and hypoxia after shutting off his supplemental oxygen to smoke cigarettes. Unfortunately, he had been unable to relieve these symptoms with the medications he had available at the residential care home. His presentation likely represented poor pulmonary status secondary to end-stage COPD rather than an acute exacerbation of COPD. Both admissions were thought to be triggered by hypoxia secondary to being off home oxygen in the setting of smoking cigarettes. After discussion of goals of care with the family and patient during the second admission, the patient was transitioned to comfort care.



================================================================================

Title: The NSTEMI Curbside Consultation

The Case:
A 52-year-old woman with coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and drug-eluting stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 2013, complicated by ischemic cardiomyopathy, presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea, cough and fever. She was found to have hypoxemia and her chest X-ray showed patchy consolidations bilaterally, confluent in the right upper lung. She had a positive troponin test without ischemic electrocardiographic changes. She was admitted and started on antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. Given her history of progressive dyspnea, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed that showed her left ventricular systolic function had worsened from an ejection fraction (EF) of 50-55% to 25-30%, without new wall motion abnormalities. Her troponin continued to rise, from 0.09 to 0.15, without electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. The inpatient medicine team obtained a “curbside” cardiology consultation; the consultant felt that her condition was consistent with demand ischemia and that the worsening of her systolic function could be consistent with acute pulmonary edema. The patient was therefore diuresed and continued on antibiotics. Her hypoxemia improved with resolved infiltrates on chest radiography. She was discharged home after a four-day hospitalization to complete her antibiotic course; she was told to resume her home diuretic regimen and plan for cardiology follow-up within a week.

The patient’s follow-up with cardiology did not occur until two months after discharge. At that time, a nuclear stress test was ordered, which showed a large perfusion defect suggestive of infarction. Subsequent left heart catheterization with coronary angiography showed 100% mid-LAD occlusion and a hypokinetic scar in the distal anterior wall and apex. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no viability of the mid-anterior wall of the left ventricle. A multidisciplinary conference with interventional cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery specialists concluded that there was no benefit to be gained by percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization.

================================================================================

Title: Misdiagnosis of a Pelvic Mass versus Pregnancy

The Case:
A 28-year-old woman arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of back pain and bloody vaginal discharge. She reported some missed periods and a positive urine pregnancy test at home but had not received any prenatal care and was unsure of her expected due date.



The initial physician evaluating the patient was an intern on their first day of service in a busy Emergency Department. The intern suspected complications of early pregnancy including ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and gestational trophoblastic disease. After cursory review by a more experienced physician, a pelvic ultrasound was ordered as a “first trimester” examination. Active labor was not suspected by the ED physicians.



The on-call sonographer was trained in abdominal ultrasound but had limited experience in fetal sonography. The patient’s obesity limited the ultrasound assessment; the quality of the ultrasound images was poor. The sonographer did not recognize that the patient was in her third trimester based on a review of the images, and mistakenly identified the fetal head as a “pelvic mass.” The radiologist on call was experienced in abdominal ultrasound but had limited experience in fetal ultrasound. The sonographic images were reviewed remotely, and the radiologist also failed to recognize that the “pelvic mass” was actually a fetal head. The radiologist did not repeat pertinent aspects of the ultrasound exam himself.



Subsequently, a consultation was sought from the obstetrics/gynecology team on call, which was completed four hours after the patient had arrived to the ED. Based on their evaluation, including a pelvic examination and repeated pelvic ultrasound at the bedside, they recognized that the patient was in her third trimester and in active labor. The patient was transferred to Labor and Delivery, where standard procedures for labor management were initiated. The initial fetal heart rate tracing (FHRT) was category 1 (normal), but variable decelerations were later noted (category 2) which deteriorated to fetal bradycardia. The obstetric team proceeded to an emergent cesarean section that was successfully accomplished. Apgar scores at one, five, and ten minutes were 2, 2, and 7, respectively. The infant then suffered a neonatal seizure. Subsequent investigation revealed a perinatal thrombotic infarct of the left basal ganglia that was confirmed on brain MRI. It could not be determined if the perinatal stroke was a result of an antenatal insult or a consequence of the labor and delivery.



================================================================================

Title: Multiple High-Risk Events Involving Workflow for Wasting of Medications Used by Anesthesia

The Case:


An anesthesiologist administered a dose of intravenous fentanyl to Patient #1 at the end of a surgical procedure. There was leftover medication in the syringe that needed to be safely disposed of, or “wasted”; the anesthesiologist placed a medication label on the syringe and then placed it in his pocket. The anesthesiologist proceeded to his next case, and after Patient #2 was induced and stable, the anesthesiologist placed this fentanyl syringe in the pocket of the automated dispensing cabinet (ADC) and notified the resident of the need to waste the medication. The resident mistakenly removed the syringe to be wasted from the ADC pocket during the procedure and administered the medication to Patient #2. Upon identification of the error, both patients involved were notified and an incident report was filed. When reviewing the event, investigators also noted several incidental findings of unsecured propofol in several areas including on top of a medication cart and in the computed tomography (CT) scan room.



================================================================================

Title: Delayed Management of Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection – Who does the Patient Belong To?

The Case:
A 52-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care university hospital after recently undergoing cosmetic abdominoplasty at a private community hospital. Upon evaluation in the ED, the patient was found to have a profound lactic acidosis and leukocytosis, and vasopressor medication was initiated through a peripheral intravenous catheter.

The Plastic Surgery service was notified and evaluated the patient; the team recommended debridement of a presumed necrotizing soft tissue infection (a.k.a., necrotizing fasciitis) by the Emergency General Surgery (EGS) service. An intern from the EGS service evaluated the patient and discussed the patient with the EGS attending on call. However, the EGS attending refused to see the patient because the patient had undergone a “plastic surgery procedure.” The Emergency Medicine attending did not communicate the EGS attending’s refusal to see the patient to the Plastic Surgery team who initially evaluated the patient. Four hours later, the Plastic Surgery attending realized the patient was still in the ED and had not been treated and decided to intervene. The delay in treatment allowed the infection more time to progress, and the patient ultimately required excision of a large area of skin and soft tissue. The patient was subsequently admitted to an Intensive Care Unit for several days.

================================================================================

Title: Some Patients Can't Wait: Improving Timeliness of Emergency Department Care

The Case:
A 46-year-old woman with a history of a stroke ten months prior, methamphetamine use, and remote endovascular repair of a thoracic aortic dissection, presented to the emergency department (ED) triage nurse at 12:38am with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting.  Her vital signs included: blood pressure 154/113 mmHg, heart rate 75 beats/minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths/minute, room air pulse oximetry 98%, and oral temperature 36.6˚C. The triage nurse assigned Emergency Severity Index (ESI) category 2. Because the ED was busy with no available beds, the patient remained in the waiting room. No further nursing assessments or vital signs were recorded until 5:40am when the patient became increasingly tachycardic, tachypneic, and pale, and began to scream in pain on the waiting room floor. She was taken immediately to the resuscitation room and was assessed by the Emergency Medicine attending and resident physicians. The ED care team obtained vascular access, sent a battery of laboratory tests, and ordered imaging studies. The lactic acid value was 10.2 mmol/L (normal 0.9 - 1.7 mmol/L). A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed at 7:00am and revealed a ruptured thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm. The emergency physicians immediately consulted the Vascular Surgery team, which evaluated the patient at 7:30am and agreed to take the patient to the operating room (OR). Surgery was scheduled at 7:54am as a 0-2 hour case while surgical staff prepared the specialized vascular OR. The patient’s ED nurse called the OR to arrange transport and was told someone would be down to transport the patient to surgery in 30 minutes when the room became available.  At 8:57am, while still in the ED waiting for the OR, the patient developed hypotension and agonal respirations. She then became unresponsive and pulseless. The team called a code blue, initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and administered blood products. Unfortunately, she could not be resuscitated and died in the ED.

================================================================================

Title: Is that solution for IV or irrigation?: Fluid administration errors in the operating room.

The Case:
Two different patients experienced similar events.

Event #1: A 28-year-old woman was admitted for deceased donor renal transplant surgery. A bag of 1000 mL normal saline with 160 mg gentamicin bladder irrigation solution was prepared prior to surgery and was hung on the patient’s IV pole.  When the nurse went to connect the irrigation solution to the patient’s urinary catheter, it was found to be already connected and attached to the patient’s IV tubing, though it had not yet been infused.

Event #2: A 50-year-old woman was admitted for deceased donor renal transplant surgery. A bag of 1000 mL normal saline with 160 mg gentamicin bladder irrigation solution was prepared in the operating room (OR) prior to surgery.  The solution was labeled with the contents, date and time and placed in the warmer.  When the nurse went to retrieve the solution, it was missing from the warmer. It was found hanging on the patient’s intravenous (IV) pole attached to her IV, though it had not been infused.



================================================================================

Title: Right Electrocardiogram, Wrong Patient

The Case:
Multiple electrocardiograms (EKGs) were incorrectly documented at a large urban tertiary care hospital over three months. All of the cases involved the nurse or EKG technician either entering the wrong medical record number (MRN), or not clearing the previous patient’s MRN from in the machine, while entering a new patient’s name. The incorrect patient documentation on the EKG caused EKG results to be uploaded to the wrong patients’ charts.

One case involved a female infant whose treating physician received an electronic medical record (EMR) message shortly after her discharge from the hospital with the electrocardiogram result of sinus bradycardia and/or sinus arrest. Upon this physician’s review, an EKG had never been ordered on this patient throughout her hospital stay, nor did the EKG diagnosis fit with the clinical history of the patient. Upon further review it was determined that the EKG recorded was from a patient in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) but had been recorded in the wrong patient chart.

================================================================================

Title: Incomplete Orders for Hypertonic Saline to Treat Hyponatremia

The Case:
A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by his family members who stated that they had found him unconscious at home with multiple empty bottles of alcoholic beverages nearby. The patient was found to be confused and severely hyponatremic with a blood sodium level of 109 mEq/L (the lower limit of the normal range in adults is 135 mEq/l). This level placed the patient at risk for life-threatening seizures, so he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and anephrologyconsultant was urgently called.

The nephrologist briefly reviewed the laboratory results and asked the intensivist to administer hypertonic saline immediately to increase the sodium level, and to recheck the sodium level in one hour. ("Hypertonic" saline contains 3% sodium, compared to normal saline solutions which are composed of 0.9% sodium.) He did not specify how much hypertonic saline should be administered. When the nephrologist came to the ICU about two hours later, the patient's confusion had not improved. The repeat laboratory results showed that the sodium had risen to 130 mEq/dL, a rapid increase that put the patient at risk of severe neurologic complications.

Given this rapid correction, the nephrologist asked what medications had been administered and noticed that a 500 mL bag of hypertonic saline had nearly finished infusing. The infusion was stopped immediately, and the patient was administered dextrose, free water, and desmopressin to mitigate the effect of the rapid sodium correction. Fortunately, the patient's sodium stabilized and his mental status gradually improved. The next day, he was conscious, oriented, and answering questions appropriately. He was eventually discharged to an inpatient alcohol use disorder treatment center.

An incident report was filed due to the medication error. Investigation revealed that the intensivist had intended to order administration of 50 mL of 3% saline. However, the default intravenous fluid order in the hospital's computerized order entry system was for a 500 mL infusion. A separate, customizable order was available but not easily accessible. In a rush, the intensivist ordered the 500 mL infusion and added a free-text comment to "infuse 50 cc then recheck sodium." Unfortunately, the free-text comment was missed both by the pharmacist and the ICU nurse, resulting in the patient receiving a much larger infusion at a faster rate than intended.

================================================================================

Title: Patient Identification Errors: A Systems Challenge

The Case:
The following four events involving five patients all involved incorrect patient identification in a large tertiary care hospital; all cases were reported to the hospital’s patient safety committee within a 4-week period. Together, these cases serve to highlight several important systems issues.

Event #1 involved a 68-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) from the ambulatory clinic with nausea, vomiting and altered mental status. She had a history of untreated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity and had erythema and signs of possible cellulitis. The emergency medicine physician ordered non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen/pelvis and head. The patient was transported to radiology and mistakenly received a CT of the right upper extremity with contrast, which had been ordered for another patient with the same first name (but a different surname).

Event #2 involved two patients whose ED visits overlapped in time. Patient #1 was a 23-year-old man found unconscious outside a bar with multiple facial injuries and bruises on his chest and abdomen. Patient #2 was a 21-year-old man with facial injuries and head pain following a motor vehicle accident. These two patients, both with head and facial injuries and of similar age, were admitted to neighboring rooms in the ED and orders for CT of the head, face, and cervical spine without contrast were placed for both; each patient’s scan was mistakenly performed under the other patient’s name, and the wrong results appeared in both patients’ charts. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was also ordered for Patient #1 but was performed on Patient #2, for whom no additional CT had been ordered. Upon receiving all the CT results, the ED team recognized that the results were not consistent with physical exams and, subsequently, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was appropriately carried out on Patient #1 and all results were correctly relabeled.

Event #3 involved a 2-year-old patient who presented to the ED, subsequently underwent surgery, recovered in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and was admitted to the pediatric unit late in the day. The next day, the night shift RN discovered the child had another patient’s identification (ID) band on her wrist. The ID band belonged to an 8-month-old baby boy who also had been seen in the ED the previous day but had been discharged home later that day.

Event #4 was a 21-year-old female patient seen in the ED. While receiving an electrocardiogram (EKG), this patient was found by the EKG technician to have another patient’s ID band on her wrist. The ID band belonged to a 60-year-old male and had been placed on the patient by the triage nurse.

================================================================================

Title: “This is the wrong patient's blood!”: Evaluating a Near-Miss Wrong Transfusion Event

The Case:
A 74-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%, stage I chronic kidney disease and gout presented for a total hip replacement. His home medications included lisinopril, metoprolol, colchicine, sertraline, acetaminophen and oxycodone as needed, and warfarin, which was withheld appropriately prior to the surgery.

The patient was seen by the surgical and anesthesia teams in the preoperative holding area the morning of surgery. An intravenous (IV) line was placed and a “type and cross for blood” request was sent along with baseline laboratory tests. At our institution, an initial blood sample is sent in a purple tube from the holding area and then the blood bank will request a second confirmatory sample in a pink tube. The anesthesiologist marks the first tube with a patient sticker, date, time, and initials. The blood bank then sends a pink tube with pre-made labels to the operating room (OR) for a second blood sample.

Shortly into the case, the patient became hypotensive and vasopressors were initiated. During this time, the patient's pink tube for the confirmatory blood sample was delivered to the room. The anesthesiologist filled the tube with blood and sent it back to the blood bank. About an hour into the case significant bleeding was encountered and a blood transfusion was needed. The patient information on the blood bags was checked per institution policy, which requires a witness signature. It was quickly discovered that the blood delivered contained the wrong labels. The blood bank was notified, the blood returned, and a new blood sample sent. Because the patient was persistently hypotensive and still bleeding, a massive transfusion protocol was initiated to rapidly get blood to the room. Uncrossed universal donor blood was delivered and administered, and the patient's hemodynamic parameters recovered appropriately.

================================================================================

Title: A Mistaken Dose of Naloxone

The Case:
A 55-year-old man with widely metastatic gastric cancer presented to his oncologist's office for a follow-up appointment. He had just completed cycle 2 of FOLFOX chemotherapy and reported feeling relatively well. His symptoms included some fatigue in the week after chemotherapy, but his abdominal and bony pain due to metastases was well controlled with opioid therapy (approximately 200 oral morphine equivalents per day). Examination and imaging confirmed that the disease was responding, so they planned to continue chemotherapy with the next dose scheduled for the following week.

At the end of the visit, the oncologist electronically ordered refills of the patient's pain medications, and a best practice alert (BPA) prompted him to also prescribe naloxone (a medication that can reverse an opioid overdose) intranasal spray. The naloxone BPA was part of the cancer center's new initiative to reduce opioid-related adverse events. The oncologist followed the prompt and ordered the naloxone but did not inform the patient or educate him on its indication and appropriate use. The patient then picked up his medications at his usual local pharmacy, but the pharmacist also did not provide any naloxone education to the patient.

Upon arriving home, the patient took out his new medications and administered an intranasal dose of naloxone (4 mg). Within a minute, he developed severe abdominal pain and bone pain. He called the 24 x 7 cancer center helpline and described what happened. They diagnosed the patient as having developed a pain crisis due to the effects of the naloxone and advised him to come to the urgent care center, where intravenous opioids were administered for uncontrolled pain. He was monitored for a few hours, and his home pain regimen was reinitiated.

A root cause analysis was performed by the hospital's safety committee, which revealed that pharmacists were tasked with reviewing naloxone prescriptions and providing education for patients within the health system's pharmacies, but no such mechanism existed for "outside pharmacies." They identified a need for alternative, proactive education plans for situations in which prescriptions are sent to pharmacies outside the health system. Additionally, they realized BPAs should be paired with sufficient staff training and clear role designations for prescribing physicians, pharmacists, and nurses.

================================================================================

Title: The Need to Eat

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with a history of Wernicke–Korsakoff encephalopathy – a degenerative brain disorder caused by the lack of vitamin B1 – was admitted for possible aspiration pneumonia complicated by empyema and coagulopathy. The patient was alert and oriented to his name, but not the date or location, on admission.  He became agitated and uncooperative during the hospitalization, with presumed delirium. Soft restraints with mitts were required tomaintain life-sustaining lines and chest tubes.Over the first 10 days of hospitalization, the patient refused most oral nutrition and medications. On day 11, he was taken to the operating room for video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) decortication of his pleural space due to his persistent empyema. After returning to the ward, his diet order was not restarted. The patient received maintenance intravenous fluids but had no other nutrition for four days postoperatively, until he finally expressed hunger and it was noted that he was not receiving meals.

During this time, the nursing staff had also stopped offering oral medications because of the patient's numerous prior refusals. As a result, he did not receive any of his prescribed oral medications for hypertension or his metronidazole for the aspiration pneumonia. Once the patient expressed hunger, the diet order was restarted, and a feeding consultwas ordered. The patient was identified as having difficulty swallowing and ultimately a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed to deliver both nutrition and medications.

================================================================================

Title: "Do You Want Everything Done?": Clarifying Code Status

The Case:
A 63-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation secondary to hepatitis C, low back pain, and depression presented to the emergency department with hematemesis. Despite her chronic conditions, she was generally quite healthy, working as an office manager and frequently traveling to see her children and grandchildren. She was admitted by a second-year medical resident who ordered the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for her upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

As asking about code status is a normal part of the admission process, the resident asked the patient if "she would want everything done" if she were to get sicker. The patient paused and replied, "You know, I don't think I'd want to be kept alive on machines, that's for sure." The resident interpreted this to mean the patient would not want resuscitation under any circumstances, and thus felt that her code status should be do not resuscitate and do not intubate (DNR/DNI). Unfortunately, the resident did not enter this order into the computer, although he mentioned it in his progress note. So, per the admission orders, the patient was listed as a "full code" by default.

In the morning, the admitting resident presented the case to the daytime medical team, including the DNR/DNI code status. The team was somewhat surprised by the code status given the patient's general good health. Early in the afternoon, the attending physician and intern on the team met with the patient to discuss her wishes. In a longer conversation, the patient clarified that she would not want chest compressions (as she had seen her husband receive these in the past when he died) but would accept short-term mechanical ventilation for reversible causes. She repeated that she would not want prolonged mechanical ventilation. Based on this, they deemed her code status to be "partial code."

The patient was taken for an endoscopy for the upper gastrointestinal bleeding about that same time and was intubated for the procedure. In parallel, the intern placed the order to change the patient's code status from "full" to "partial" code. Right after intubation in the endoscopy suite, the anesthesiologist and gastroenterologist noticed the change in code status. They were no longer comfortable proceeding with the endoscopy, because they lacked the ability to respond fully with resuscitation if something were to go wrong during the procedure. Yet, the patient was already intubated and sedated.

They urgently contacted the daytime medical team, and the teams met briefly in the endoscopy suite. Under the circumstances, they realized they had three options: (a) proceed with the procedure without changing the code status and assume the risk that, if something went wrong with the procedure, the patient could not receive chest compressions and may die; (b) extubate without performing the procedure, discuss the decision with the patient, and potentially reintubate if that was consistent with her wishes; or (c) change the code status without the patient's explicit consent and proceed with the procedure.

In the end, they believed the third option from above best respected the patient’s wishes and minimized harm, so they temporarily changed her code status to "full code," completed the procedure, and then discussed the situation with the patient afterward. The endoscopy was performed without any complications and the patient was extubated afterward.

================================================================================

Title: Missed Opportunities for Suicide Risk Assessment

The Case:
Patient 1

A 46-year-old homeless male was found in the parking lot of the emergency department (ED) expressing suicidal ideation (SI) and was brought into the ED. The triage nurse entered a positive suicide screen in the flowsheet which triggered an evaluation by Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES).

The patient’s medical record indicated he had multiple chronic diseases and, of note, a suspicious lesion (revealed by a recent CT scan) that the patient had been told may indicate lung cancer. This patient was a well-known “frequent flyer” with multiple ED visits associated with excessive alcohol consumption and SI. In fact, the patient had six ED visits in the previous three months and in half of those visits he had expressed SI. On one of those visits, he stated that he had tried to hang himself the day before. When seen by a social worker the next day, he denied having thoughts of suicide and was discharged; he did not qualify for a 5150 hold at that visit.

During this current ED evaluation, prior to being seen by PES, the patient was intubated due to acute hypoxia; he was extubated within 12 hours. A suicide assessment by the ED physician was not noted in chart; however, the nursing flowsheet contained two documented assessments stating no SI. No psychiatric evaluation was carried out.

The ED staff arranged for placement in a boarding home (licensed or unlicensed, short-term housing with limited care) and the patient was discharged after being prescribed Valium for delirium tremens, cardiac medications, and antibiotics for a respiratory infection. Two days later the hospital was notified by a relative that the patient was found deceased, of unknown cause, behind a retail store.

Patient 2

A 76-yr-old male with a history of hypertension and depression was brought into the hospital via ambulance after his wife reported that he was unconscious following three days of altered level of consciousness. Alcohol intoxication with possible withdrawal seizures was the admitting diagnosis. The patient was intubated and placed on continuous EEG monitoring and Neurology noted moderate to severe encephalopathy likely due to medications. The drug screen came back negative except for abnormal levels of Fluoxetine, Amitriptyline, and Nortriptyline. A social worker reviewed the case in the ED but did not see the patient after he was admitted.

The patient was extubated on hospital day two and Internal Medicine noted that a social service evaluation for alcohol abuse intervention was considered but, for some reason, was not ordered. After extubation, the patient wanted to go home and became agitated, cursing and stating, “it is wasting time” and “I should not be here.” No suicide risk assessment was conducted by nursing or social services staff after the patient was extubated and able to communicate. The patient left the hospital against medical advice and was found dead by a neighbor the next day from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to head.

Title: Complications of Vascular Access Procedures in Patients with Kidney Disease

The Case:
Three patients were at the same hospitalover the course of a few months for vascular access device (VAD) placement and experienced adverse outcomes. The adverse outcomes of two of them were secondary to drugs given for sedation, while the third patient’s situation was somewhat different.

Patient 1:

A 31-year-old woman with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and pulmonary hypertension presented in the Vascular Access Unit for revision of a malfunctioning right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter. Her home medications were reviewed by a nurse and it was documented that she had been taking hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as needed for pain. She was not noted to be on any benzodiazepines or other opioids at the time of admission. The patient reported anxiety in the pre-operative area and received 1 mg of lorazepam followed by 50 mg of diphenhydramine intravenously. The patient then became very sleepy and was unable to maintain her airway; insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway was therefore required to continue the procedure. Her vital signs were stable throughout the procedure and no additional sedation was necessary. After the procedure, she remained very sleepy but arousable. After several hours of observation, her condition was considered to be stable and she was discharged. The day after the procedure, the patient was found at home in cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at a different community hospital. Her toxicology report in the hospital emergency department was positive for amphetamines, opiates and benzodiazepines.

Patient 2:

A 52-year-old man with a history of ESRD, heart failure, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and venous thromboembolism was admitted for left arm swelling and pain. The patient was taken to the Vascular Access Unit for a fistulogram and was given 100 mcg fentanyl and 2 mg midazolam intravenously for sedation. The patient became apneic and was unable to maintain his airway, so an oral airway was inserted, and naloxone 0.2 mg was given for reversal. The patient became arousable and able to maintain his airway without further incident.

Patient 3:

A 47-year-old woman with ESRD, cardiac sarcoidosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented in the Vascular Access Unit for outpatient percutaneous thrombectomy for a clotted fistula. Procedural sedation with 175 mcg fentanyl and 3.5 mg midazolam was given intravenously and the procedure was successful. Afterward, the patient became unresponsive due to a cardiac arrest during transport and a Code Blue was called. She was then transferred to the emergency department where she experienced another cardiorespiratory arrest and expired.

Title: Cardiac Arrest in a Woman with UTI: A Case of QT Prolongation

The Case:
A 36-year-old woman with a history of depression, bipolar disorder and a recent manic episode requiring inpatient psychiatric hospitalization presented with complaints of abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, and generalized weakness. On admission, she was found to have a urinary tract infection and was started on intravenous levofloxacin. She was severely volume depleted and received intravenous hydration, including her home medications, which included quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic and lithium for her bipolar disease. She also received multiple doses of intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide as treatment for nausea.

Eighteen hours after admission, she was observed to be bradycardic with a widening QRS complex on telemetry. On bedside evaluation, the patient was found to be unresponsive and pulseless; cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. A quick chart review revealed that the patient was receiving her multiple antipsychotic medications, intravenous levofloxacin and several doses of ondansetron and metoclopramide. She was resuscitated according to the advanced cardiac life support protocol and received intravenous calcium, magnesium and sodium bicarbonate. She achieved return of spontaneous circulation. At that time, her electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval of 610 msec, which was attributed by the clinical team to concomitant use of multiple QT-prolonging medications. No electrocardiogram had been obtained at the time of admission, so the patient’s QT interval on antipsychotic medications alone could not be ascertained.

Title: Think Like a Surgeon

The Case:
A patient with a history of T6 paraplegia due to a motor vehicle accident was brought to the emergency department due to delirium. He was found to be hypotensive and febrile. Laboratory tests revealed a high white blood cell count and mild elevation of his bilirubin and liver enzymes. His physical examination was unremarkable, but given the laboratory findings, the emergency physician was concerned for hepatitis or cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder due to obstructing gallstones) as the cause of his hypotension. A stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed that showed a mildly thickened gallbladder wall but no definitive evidence of gallstones, acute cholecystitis, or liver findings. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a provisional diagnosis of septic shock. He was empirically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intravenous fluids.

The patient's delirium and hypotension improved and he defervesced. However, results of blood and urine cultures were negative, and no clear source of infection was found. His bilirubin and liver enzymes remained elevated. He was transferred to the ward on hospital day 2. Shortly after arriving on the ward, he had a low-grade fever. The hospitalist who received the patient on the ward examined the patient and realized his diagnosis was still unclear. She noted the CT findings of a thickened gallbladder wall and decided to obtain another CT scan. Results showed that the patient had a 6 cm abscess adjacent to the liver, likely arising from an acutely inflamed gallbladder that had perforated. A surgical consultation was immediately obtained, and the patient underwent an urgent open cholecystectomy and drainage of the abscess. He remained hospitalized for several more days, but he was ultimately discharged home in good condition.

On reviewing the case, the surgeon thought that the patient had in fact presented with acute cholecystitis and that surgery consultation should have been obtained earlier. The ICU physician expressed surprise when the surgeon brought this up with him, as the patient did not have any abdominal symptoms during his stay in the ICU.

================================================================================

Title: Getting the Diagnosis Both Right and Wrong

The Case:
A 27-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia was sent to the emergency department (ED) from the outpatient oncology infusion center for shortness of breath after receiving chemotherapy. On arrival in the ED, the patient was hypotensive and intravenous fluids were rapidly administered. Laboratory tests showed acute kidney injury with markedly elevated levels of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. This constellation of findings was highly suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome—metabolic abnormalities due to rapid destruction of cancer cells by the chemotherapy drugs. The patient's oncologist was contacted, who agreed with this provisional diagnosis.

The decision was made to start emergent hemodialysis to address the electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's blood pressure improved with fluids. Further laboratory results showed neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and a chest radiograph showed a right-sided infiltrate. After a dialysis catheter was placed, the patient began experiencing worsening dyspnea and was emergently intubated. She was then transferred to the intensive care unit. Consultants from nephrology, oncology, and intensive care had all seen the patient while she was in the ED, and the consultants and primary team agreed on the need to start treatment for tumor lysis syndrome with hemodialysis and other measures.

Six hours after admission, the patient's blood pressure started to drop, requiring further intravenous fluids as well as vasopressor administration. Despite aggressive measures to maintain her circulation, blood pressures further dropped, and a code blue was called. Despite 45 minutes of resuscitative efforts, the patient never regained a heartbeat and was pronounced dead less than 9 hours after presentation.

While the patient was being coded, the laboratory called the ICU to report that the patient had blood cultures positive for gram positive cocci. Review of the laboratory results and chart revealed that the ICU team had ordered blood cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics while the patient was in the ED, but the antibiotics were not administered until after the patient was transferred to the ICU. An autopsy was performed, which confirmed that although the patient did have tumor lysis syndrome, the cause of death was septic shock due to a disseminatedStaphylococcus aureusinfection.

A formal case review was conducted and the case was discussed at the departmental Morbidity and Mortality conference. The review revealed missed opportunities to detect sepsis at multiple points in the care of the patient. Antibiotic orders were placed, but the ED nurse did not see the order because she was busy assisting with the multiple procedures the patient required while in the ED. Moreover, these orders were not placed until more than 3 hours after the patient had presented. The major cause of the missed diagnosis of sepsis was thought to be the focus on tumor lysis syndrome. The priority for the primary team and consultants was around managing this oncologic emergency, with the result that a concomitant serious infection was not considered.

================================================================================

Title: Renal Failure Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

The Case:
A 65-year-old man was referred to urology for a 5-year history of progressive urinary frequency, nocturnal urination, and difficulty initiating a stream, which had worsened considerably in the past month. In the 1990s, his father had undergone TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) surgery that resulted in "miserable incontinence and impotence" for the remainder of his life. His father's experiences made the patient reluctant to seek care for his own symptoms lest he require surgery and develop similar complications.

At his first visit to the urologist's office, the patient was seen by a physician assistant who inquired about prior prostate specific antigen (PSA) results. According to the patient, when he answered that he had never had PSA testing, he was berated for not having obtained what the physician assistant stated was an important and essential test. The patient, who was a research scientist, explained that he had reviewed the literature and most recent recommendations, which suggested that the risks of testing outweighed its benefits. The patient felt that the physician assistant seemed both unaware of these controversies as well as dismissive of his choice.

Later in the visit, an in-office bladder scan read 999 mL, the upper limit of detection for the machine. A subsequent scan after voiding was 500 mL. Despite the patient's expressed views on PSA testing, the physician assistant proceeded to order laboratory work including a PSA test, scheduled a cystoscopy, and urged the patient to self-catheterize should his symptoms worsen (without any instructions or demonstration). Because of this negative interaction and resulting mistrust of the provider, the patient elected not to follow up with laboratory work and canceled his scheduled cystoscopy, as he felt that no one had adequately explained to him why it was needed. The urology physician assistant also prescribed tamsulosin (an alpha-blocker), but the patient quickly discontinued the drug after experiencing severe lightheadedness.

Ten weeks after the initial visit at the urologist's office, the patient began to feel progressively "woozy, headache-y, and dizzy," but without acute changes in urinary symptoms. He saw a nurse practitioner at his primary care physician's office, who felt he looked urgently ill and found his blood pressure to be dangerous elevated (230/170 mm Hg). She directed him to the nearest emergency department, where his creatinine was found to be markedly elevated at 14.9 mg/dL (normal range 0.6–1.2 mg/dL). A urinary catheter was inserted, with 2 L of urine immediately drained.

He was admitted to the hospital for the next 6 days, during which his renal function gradually improved. His creatinine came down to 4.3 mg/dL. He was discharged home with an indwelling urinary catheter and a follow-up appointment with the same urologist's office where he had first presented.

At that follow-up appointment, he was told he was "ready for surgery"—despite his fears of potentially developing a bad outcome based on his father's experience—and was told that the department would be in touch to schedule a TURP. He never received a call back, however, and having decided he would have nothing further to do with that urology office, he instead contacted a urologist at another hospital. Several months later, the patient underwent a TURP without complications and eventually was able to have the catheter removed with return of normal voiding. His renal function also slowly improved; however, 1 year later it remained abnormal with a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL.

================================================================================

Title: Anemia and Delayed Colon Cancer Diagnosis

The Case:
An 81-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban presented to his primary care physician (PCP) with a hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL (normal range in men: 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL). His hemoglobin had been normal 6 months earlier. A colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening was normal 2 years prior to this presentation.

At this visit with his PCP, his vital signs were normal and physical examination was unremarkable. A fecal occult blood test was not performed. The patient was referred for an upper endoscopy, which showed mild gastritis. He was prescribed a proton-pump inhibitor and oral iron, and his dose of rivaroxaban was reduced. He was told that he would not need a repeat colonoscopy because his had not shown any lesions 2 years earlier. The patient had no family history of colon cancer.

Two months later, the patient's hemoglobin was found to be 8.5 g/dL. He was given two doses of intravenous iron and continued taking oral iron. His hemoglobin subsequently improved to 12 g/dL over the next 2 months.

Eight months later, the patient reported progressive fatigue and shortness of breath. A repeat hemoglobin was found to be 6.7 g/dL. A capsule endoscopy study and repeat upper endoscopy were performed and both were normal. He received a blood transfusion as well as additional iron infusions, resulting in an improvement in his hemoglobin to 10 g/dL.

Four months later—2 years after his initial presentation—his hemoglobin fell again to 7.4 g/dL, and the patient received another blood and iron transfusion. Two days after this infusion, he presented to the emergency department with a bowel obstruction and was subsequently diagnosed with colon cancer. He underwent surgery to excise the mass and fortunately remains in remission.

================================================================================

Title: Spinal Epidural Abscess

The Case:
A 30-year-old woman with a history of prior spine surgery presented to the emergency department with a few days of progressive low back pain. She had undergone spinal fusion 1 year prior and was generally healthy and functional. She described the pain as moderate-to-severe, radiating down the left leg and buttock. Because of her prior surgery, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was ordered and showed lumbar degenerative joint disease as well as a small L5–S1 disc herniation. She was referred for physical therapy and prescribed a muscle relaxant, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), and opioids.

Because of her previous spinal fusion, she made an appointment at the orthopedic clinic 1 week after her initial presentation in the emergency department. At this point, she continued to have back pain and was developing progressive difficulty walking due to the pain. The orthopedic surgeon agreed with the emergency department evaluation and made no further changes.

Ten days later, she presented to a community hospital. She was febrile, unable to ambulate, numb from the waist down, and using a wheelchair. She had a white blood cell count of greater than 30,000 (normal range 4,000–11,000) and was found to be in acute renal and liver failure with a creatinine of 3.6 mg/dL (normal range 0.4–1.0 mg/dL) and markedly elevated liver function tests.

She was immediately transferred to a neurosurgery service at an academic hospital where an MRI showed a T6–T10 thoracic epidural abscess. The patient was taken to the operating room for drainage of the abscess. Postoperatively, she had multiple complications including a pulmonary embolism. She only partially recovered function of her legs and was mainly using a wheelchair.

Subsequent review of the initial MRI to determine why the lesion was initially missed found that the MRI was a lumbar view, which captured the levels T11 through S1 but did not include the affected spinal level (T6–T10).

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Clozapine Prescription in an Elderly Man With Dementia

The Case:
An 86-year-old man with neurodegenerative dementia, epilepsy, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension was admitted for agitation and suicidal ideation. Psychiatry was consulted and recommended initiation of clozapine at a dose of 12.5 mg daily. Because of the drug's risks for adverse effects, clozapine must be prescribed and dispensed in accordance with Food and Drug Administration regulations, which mandate a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers. The clozapine REMS program requires both prescribers and patients to be registered in an online database, in which laboratory monitoring results are regularly reported.

The REMS-registered psychiatry attending entered the initial order (12.5 mg) per hospital protocol. However, during the hospitalization, the medicine intern, who was not registered with the REMS program, titrated the dose to 25 mg daily. The intern was able to modify the dose in the hospital without any alerts because he was not writing a new order or prescription (which would have required REMS registration). Moreover, despite having had no experience with or education about REMS, the intern also wrote the discharge prescription because he was unaware that he was ineligible to prescribe clozapine.

Upon receipt of the prescription, the outpatient pharmacist checked the REMS registry and noted the medicine intern was not a registered prescriber. He contacted the attending psychiatrist, who then wrote a new prescription. However, the patient's family was unable to pick up the prescription for 3 days. During this gap in therapy, the patient experienced recurrence of paranoia and required readmission to the hospital for worsening psychiatric symptoms.

================================================================================

Title: Diuretics and Electrolyte Abnormalities

The Case:
A 62-year-old woman with morbid obesity and a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, and a previous hospitalization for hyponatremia was seen by her primary care provider for a routine visit. At the visit, the patient complained of worsening lower extremity edema over the prior few weeks. She had no shortness of breath nor other new symptoms.

On examination, her blood pressure was well controlled (128/55 mm Hg) on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and her other vital signs were normal. She did have 1–2+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities, slightly worse than her usual. Her primary care provider decided to prescribe chlorthalidone 50 mg daily for the edema, thinking it might also help with the patient's blood pressure. Her baseline creatinine was normal.

Ten days later, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with 3 days of worsening somnolence and confusion. Laboratory results revealed a serum sodium of 105 g/dL and a potassium of 2.3 g/dL. She had a seizure in the ED, which was treated with lorazepam, and she was admitted to the intensive care unit. The critical care provider consulted a nephrologist, and both agreed the severe symptomatic hyponatremia and hypokalemia had been caused by the chlorthalidone.

The patient was treated with hypertonic (3%) normal saline, potassium repletion, and supportive care. She had gradual improvement in her serum sodium and mental status over the next few days, and she was discharged home on hospital day 5.

================================================================================

Title: Failure to Rescue the Mother

The Case:
A 27-year-old woman, G5 P2 A2, was first admitted to the hospital at 25 weeks of pregnancy for vaginal bleeding. An ultrasound showed an anterior placenta, low lying and covering the cervix. She received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 2 doses of iron injections, and she was discharged after 3 days with an improved hemoglobin level.

The patient continued to have regular visits to her obstetrics clinic for monitoring. At 32 weeks, she was readmitted for vaginal bleeding, received 1 unit of packed red blood cells, and was then discharged. An ultrasound at 34 weeks revealed a central placenta previa covering the internal os and evidence of placenta percreta, with part of the placenta growing into the uterine wall. The scan results were discussed by the patient's obstetrician, the obstetrics and gynecology department chief, and a urologist, and they recommended that the delivery be done by elective lower segment cesarean delivery with possible hysterectomy.

At 35 weeks, the patient was admitted for the elective cesarean delivery. Intraoperatively, placenta previa and percreta were confirmed, an upper uterine segment incision was made, and the newborn was delivered in good condition. Immediately after, a subtotal hysterectomy was performed, during which the urologist dissected the bladder so that the cervix could be removed with a vaginal cuff. The anesthesiologist then noted that the patient was hypotensive; blood was transfused. A rash developed surrounding the transfusion site and then widespread ecchymosis appeared as the patient became more unstable. The physicians attempted to stabilize the patient with fluids and medications. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 60 minutes, but the patient died.

Root cause analysis of the case revealed several crucial missed steps in preparing for this procedure, including failure to order a complete blood count on admission, failure to ensure blood availability for the surgery, lack of knowledge by the anesthesiologist of the patient's history of bleeding and prior transfusions, slow response to the patient's deteriorating condition, and failure to detect the early signs of a potential transfusion reaction.

================================================================================

Title: If You Say So: Taking a Syringe at Face Value in the Operating Room

The Case:
A 43-year-old woman was admitted for open reduction and internal fixation of a forearm fracture. She was overweight but otherwise healthy and was not taking any medications prior to admission.

The procedure was staffed by a resident who had been rotating from another specialty for approximately 3 months and was being supervised by a consultant anesthesiologist. The consultant happened to also be working as an intensivist, so after inducing anesthesia and maintaining the patient on inhalational anesthesia, the consultant stepped out to tend to another patient in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the operating room, the patient's heart rate dropped below 50 beats per minute, and the resident asked the anesthesia technician to draw up 0.5 mg of atropine. The technician returned with an unlabeled 2 mL syringe without the original ampule. The resident was reluctant to administer the drug without verifying the product, but the anesthesia technician insisted it was atropine so a double check was not performed.

As the resident injected the drug, the consultant returned to the operating room. Over the next few minutes, the patient's blood pressure skyrocketed to 250/135 mm Hg. The consultant emergently administered labetalol, glycopyrrolate, and high-concentration sevoflurane to antagonize the effect of the drug, which he assumed was some kind of vasoconstrictor.

Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the ampule the technologist used to make the 2 mL syringe actually contained 10 mg of phenylephrine instead of 0.5 mg of atropine. The patient was observed in the ICU overnight and did not experience any lasting harm from the incident.

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Sepsis Management Due to Ambiguous Allergy

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a past medical history of hemorrhagic stroke, coronary artery disease, and severe aplastic anemia required immunosuppressive therapy (antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and prednisone) and regular blood and platelet transfusions. On the day of presentation, the patient arrived at the infusion center for a scheduled platelet transfusion. Prior to starting the infusion, he became unresponsive and hypotensive (59/26 mm Hg). The patient was immediately transported to the emergency department (ED) where, after resuscitation, he described a 1-day history of lethargy, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, and bloody bowel movements. Additionally, the patient had an allergy to penicillin, with a reaction of hives documented in the electronic health record. However, it was unclear when this reaction had occurred or whether it had been witnessed by a health care provider.

In the ED, the patient's vital signs were initially stable: temperature 36.7°C, blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg, heart rate 57 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 94%. Physical examination was notable for a tired-appearing man with slight abdominal distention without significant tenderness or peritoneal findings. A complete blood count was notable for platelets of 8000/µL, white blood cell count of 2300/µL, and absolute neutrophil count of 1230/µL. Chemistry panel and liver function tests were within normal limits, and urinalysis was unremarkable.

Soon after the initial evaluation (during which he appeared hemodynamically stable), the patient developed hypothermia (35.3°C), hypotension (70/40 mm Hg), and worsening mental status. The patient promptly received 3 L of intravenous fluid. Given continued instability and concern for septic shock, vancomycin was administered. However, neither gram-negative nor anaerobic coverage were ordered due to concern for the penicillin allergy and unknown infection source.

The patient remained hypotensive, and a lactate level returned at 3.5 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast suggested colitis as a possible source of infection. The absence of gram-negative coverage went unrecognized until the primary admitting team took over 4 hours after the patient's initial presentation, at which point they ordered aztreonam. However, the aztreonam was not administered for another 2 hours. As the aztreonam was being given, anaerobic coverage with metronidazole was also ordered but not administered for another 9 hours. Thus, despite the patient's immunocompromised state (neutropenia and on active immunosuppressive therapy) and sepsis from a likely intraabdominal source, ordering and administration of antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage was significantly delayed.

Following the patient's prolonged ED course, he was admitted to the intensive care unit where his sepsis worsened. Antimicrobial therapy was broadened to meropenem, caspofungin, azithromycin, and vancomycin. The patient developed anuric renal failure necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy. Ultimately, he was transitioned to comfort care and died. Autopsy revealed the likely cause of death to be septic shock due to neutropenic enterocolitis.

The cause of the patient's death was deemed to be multifactorial (i.e., high medical complexity, delayed sepsis recognition, unfamiliarity with antibiotic coverage, prolonged ED boarding time, and multiple involved services). However, given the data on relationship between time to antibiotic administration and sepsis mortality, the delayed antibiotic administration likely contributed to the death. Furthermore, the documented penicillin allergy may have contributed to this delay by preventing reflexive administration of empiric gram-negative antibiotic treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime. Moreover, the lack of familiarity with the limited efficacy of aztreonam in anaerobic coverage led to a delay in the addition of appropriate anaerobic treatment.

================================================================================

Title: Speaking Up for Patient Safety: What They Don't Tell You in Training About Feedback and Burnout

The Case:
A 78-year-old man presented to the hospital with shortness of breath. He was admitted to the medicine service and chest radiograph revealed large bilateral pleural effusions. The bedside procedure service was consulted to perform a thoracentesis for both diagnostic and treatment purposes.

The proceduralist received a page from the medicine team requesting the procedure. The page contained the last name and room number of the patient. The physician entered the patient's room, identified the patient by his last name, introduced himself, and asked the patient's permission to use the ultrasound machine to assess the effusions. A patient care assistant was sitting by the patient's bedside and watching the patient closely. The patient care assistant explained to the physician that the patient had underlying dementia and was frequently confused. The physician scanned the patient and noted a small effusion on the right side. He was a bit surprised that the effusion wasn't larger given what he had been told by the patient's primary medicine team. He then called the medicine team and mentioned that he found a very small effusion on the right side, which he could attempt to sample if the team still felt it was clinically indicated.

The patient care assistant who overheard the phone exchange followed the physician out of the patient's room and politely informed him that he had in fact examined the incorrect patient. The proceduralist logged into the electronic health record to verify the patient information he had received in the page. He was shocked to find that the correct patient was in the next room and happened to have the same last name as the patient he had evaluated by mistake.

The physician immediately apologized to the patient with dementia and thanked the patient care assistant for pointing out his mistake. He then went to examine the correct patient and found that large bilateral pleural effusions were indeed present, just as the medicine team had stated. The physician nominated the patient care assistant for the hospital's Stand Up for Safety Award, designed to recognize providers and staff for speaking up and making good catches in the name of patient safety.

================================================================================

Title: Good Catch in the Operating Room

The Case:
A 46-year-old woman with extensive history of back pain from lumbar stenosis was scheduled for an elective laminectomy and spinal fusion. The procedure initially started well and the surgeon followed his expected operative plan. About halfway through the procedure, the anesthesiologist noticed that the patient's blood pressure was dropping, and she alerted the surgeon. Since the surgeon did not notice excessive bleeding, he initially continued with the procedure. The anesthesiologist administered a bolus of intravenous fluids, but over the next few minutes the patient's blood pressure continued to drop.

The anesthesiologist was very concerned about the patient and said to the surgeon, "I think we have an unsafe situation. I can't explain her hypotension. Are you sure she isn't bleeding? We should stop the procedure and figure out what's wrong." Although the surgeon was surprised by the anesthesiologist's forcefulness, he recognized her concern, stopped the procedure, and began searching for a source of bleeding. He quickly realized that the blade of the laminectomy tool was damaged and a fragment was missing, raising concern that a blood vessel may have been damaged. A vascular surgeon was urgently consulted. Upon exploration, the team realized that the damaged blade had torn the patient's iliac artery, and she was hemorrhaging into her pelvis. The patient required transfusion of multiple units of blood, and fortunately the injury was repaired before more serious consequences occurred. The patient required care in the intensive care unit postoperatively, but she recovered and was discharged home in good condition several days later.

================================================================================

Title: The Magnetic Deflection

The Case:
A 68-year-old woman with a prior history of cerebrovascular accident and hypertension presented to the hospital with new left-sided weakness and hypertensive urgency. The duration of her symptoms was unclear, and she was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy. She was admitted to the stroke unit and received aggressive treatment to control her blood pressure. A neurologist was consulted and ordered an urgent magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain.

The MRI staff informed the bedside nurse that the patient could be brought down for the study. At that time, the patient's blood pressure was still elevated, requiring pushes of intravenous antihypertensives. Nevertheless, the physician told the nurse that the study was urgent and the patient should be taken down for it.

After the patient was brought to the radiology department, she was identified and situated inside the MRI machine. The technician left the room and went back to his work station. The nurse decided to check the patient's blood pressure one more time before leaving her and found that it was improving. Reassured, she also left the room but forgot to notify the MRI technician that the blood pressure cuff was still attached to the patient.

Within a few seconds after starting the scan, there was a loud noise in the MRI room and the technician stopped the scan immediately. He entered the room and realized that the blood pressure cuff had a metal bar (around which the Velcro looped) that had been brought into the magnetic fields of the MRI scanner, which caused it (and the patient's arm) to be drawn to the MRI scanner wall with considerable force. The technician removed the offending piece of equipment and the scan was completed without further incident; luckily, the patient was not injured.

================================================================================

Title: Hip Fractures in Older Patients: the Case for Geriatrics Comanagement

The Case:
An 82-year-old man with a past medical history of dementia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes slipped on a rug at home and fell, fracturing his left hip. In the emergency department, a head CT was negative for any evidence of bleeding. Radiographs and CT scan of the pelvis and hip showed a left intertrochanteric hip fracture. Electrocardiogram showed the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia or infarction. Laboratory results revealed normal electrolytes, kidney function, and complete blood count.

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service to fix the fracture; the surgery was initially scheduled for the following day. However, surgery was delayed by 3 days due to several emergent trauma cases and lack of surgeon availability. The patient was not placed on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis prior to surgery. While in the hospital, he was frequently agitated, disoriented, and combative in the evening hours.

He ultimately underwent surgery and was discharged to home a few days later. However, he was readmitted to the hospital several weeks later with chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have a pulmonary embolism. Treatment with anticoagulation was initiated. The patient's rehabilitation was delayed, his recovery was prolonged, and he never returned to his baseline functional status. After discussion with his family, the patient was ultimately transitioned to hospice and died several months later.

================================================================================

Title: E-cigarette Explosion in a Patient Room

The Case:
A 49-year-old woman was admitted for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without any signs of infection. Her baseline oxygen requirement at home was 2 liters via nasal cannula, and she used a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine at night; however, her machine stopped working prior to the hospitalization. Throughout her hospital stay, the patient continued to require 5 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.

When asked about her smoking history, the patient reported receiving smoking cessation education in the past and that she no longer smoked regular cigarettes, but she did continue to vape with an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette). Having not been told to avoid vaping in the hospital, the patient asked her friend to bring her e-cigarette so she could use it during her hospitalization.

The patient took a puff on the e-cigarette while she was receiving oxygen through her nasal cannula and sparked an explosion. The patient ripped off the nasal cannula, which had melted, and sustained first- and second-degree burns to her face and hand. This resulted in a prolonged hospitalization for burn care and extensive pain management. In addition, the facial burns made it difficult for her to use CPAP as she had been doing at home.

The exact type of e-cigarette the patient used was not known. It did contain a heating element to vaporize the e-liquid, but it is unclear which piece of the device triggered the explosion. Regardless, the vendor who sold the e-cigarette to the patient stated it was safe to use while on oxygen.

================================================================================

Title: Duplicate Insulin Order

The Case:
A 45-year-old man with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was seen in the emergency department (ED) for complaints of lethargy and decreased oral intake. Tests revealed blood glucose levels in the 800s with an anion-gap acidosis and positive beta hydroxybutyrate. The patient stated he had not been able to afford insulin and had not taken any for the last 3 days. A bed was requested in the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

After administration of fluids, an insulin drip was started and blood sugars were monitored hourly. The patient was more awake and able to ask for food after a few hours in the ED awaiting the ICU bed. His blood sugar levels were slowly normalizing and the gap acidosis improving. Once the acidosis normalized, the team decided to convert the patient's insulin drip to subcutaneous long-acting insulin ("bridging").

The fellow asked the resident to place an order for 50 units of insulin. The resident called the ED and asked if the insulin was given. A covering nurse answered the phone and said she had not given any insulin. The resident instructed the nurse to administer 50 units of insulin and stop the insulin drip in about 1 hour. After about 30 minutes, the patient's nurse came back from break and found him to be lethargic. She immediately called the ICU team. The team instructed her to get a stat blood glucose level, which was found to be in the 30s. The insulin drip was stopped and IV dextrose pushes were given. The patient was started on dextrose 10% IV solution and blood glucose levels were monitored every 15 minutes. Within about 1 hour, the patient's blood glucose levels stabilized (> 75 mg/dL), and he became more alert.

Chart review revealed thatboththe resident and the intern had placed orders for 50 units of insulin without either of them cross-checking the orders. In addition, the patient's assigned nurse did not communicate to the covering nurse that she had given a dose of insulin, nor had the covering nurse checked the chart to see if any other doses of insulin had been given. The pharmacy noted the duplicate order, but by the time they called the ED and spoke with the patient's nurse, the patient had already received the two 50-unit doses while still on the insulin drip.

The patient recovered from the incident without apparent adverse effects. After this event, the team received training on the ED's insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis and adjustments were made to the pharmacy protocol for checking duplicate orders and dispensing insulin.

Title: Premature Extubation

The Case:
A 73-year-old woman with a history of carotid artery stenosis was admitted for an elective carotid endarterectomy. The procedure was initially thought to be uncomplicated, and the patient was extubated in the operating room. After extubation, the patient was safely brought back to the recovery area, but within 30 minutes she developed respiratory distress necessitating urgent reintubation. The reintubation required multiple attempts but was ultimately successful. The patient was taken back to the operating room and found to have an expanding neck hematoma, which was drained safely. She was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient gradually improved and was alert with intact mental status. The ICU physician felt it was appropriate to wean the patient from the ventilator with the goal of extubation later in the day. While on rounds, the intensivist planned to ask the respiratory therapist to test for a cuff leak prior to extubation. (Testing for a cuff leak involves deflating the cuff of the endotracheal tube. Patients should have normal airflow around the endotracheal tube after the cuff is deflated. If there is no cuff leak, it suggests that laryngeal edema or another type of laryngeal injury has reduced the space between the endotracheal tube and the larynx. This places the patient at risk for breathing difficulty after extubation.) However, no formal order for a cuff leak test was placed.

After a half hour weaning trial, the patient was ready to be extubated. The respiratory therapist extubated the patient without checking the cuff leak. Within about 15 minutes, the patient developed acute shortness of breath and stridor, progressing quickly to hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required urgent reintubation, which was technically difficult because her vocal cords were edematous. Eventually, an airway was established. The patient remained intubated for 2 more days and required intravenous steroids to reduce laryngeal edema. She was eventually successfully extubated and discharged home in good condition.

The ICU medical director reviewed the case and discovered that the physician had forgotten to place an order for cuff leak and had assumed that the respiratory therapist would know to perform the test, given the patient's history of difficult intubation. The respiratory therapist was covering extra patients that day due to another staff illness, which led him to overlook the need to check for a cuff leak. The medical director also realized that the ventilator weaning process was not standardized.

The ICU decided to implement a standardized protocol for positive pressure weaning trials, which also required a cuff leak test be performed, documented, and the results communicated to the physician before extubation. One year later, the ICU had seen a significant drop in unplanned reintubations after extubation.

================================================================================

Title: Which Line: Ordering Provider or Proceduralist?

The Case:
A 58-year-old woman with multiple myeloma required placement of a central venous catheter for apheresis, a blood-straining procedure to lower the level of abnormal proteins in her blood.

In general, two types of central venous catheters may be used for apheresis, a tunneled central venous catheter and a nontunneled central venous catheter. (Tunneled catheters enter the skin and then go through a tunnel right beneath the skin before entering a large central vein. A nontunneled catheter goes directly through the skin into a large central vein [e.g., internal jugular lines and subclavian catheters].) Placing tunneled catheters involves a more specialized and high-risk procedure; however, they are associated with fewer infections than nontunneled catheters and can be used for longer periods of time.

The outpatient hematology–oncology provider ordered the procedure via computerized provider order entry. The oncologist intended to order a nontunneled catheter, as a tunneled catheter was not necessary for this indication (although it would also work). But she accidentally ordered a tunneled central catheter to be placed by the interventional radiologist.

Although interventional radiologist reviewed the order and thought it was somewhat unusual that a tunneled catheter was ordered for apheresis, she didn't contact the oncologist. The patient was consented for the procedure and a tunneled catheter was placed without complications.

When the patient presented for apheresis treatment, providers recognized that the wrong catheter had been placed. The oncologist and interventional radiologist discussed the case and decided it would be safest and most appropriate to remove the tunneled catheter and replace it with a nontunneled catheter. The error was disclosed to the patient, the tunneled catheter was removed, and the appropriate catheter was placed. There were no complications but a slight delay in initiating apheresis. Moreover, the extra procedure placed the patient at risk for procedural complications.

================================================================================

Title: Diagnostic Failure: The Growing Deficit

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to a hospital's telemetry floor for management of uncontrolled hypertension and palpitations. She was seen by a hospitalist, who ordered an echocardiogram, instituted treatment for hypertensive urgency, and consulted a cardiologist. On the afternoon of the first hospital day, the patient complained of right arm numbness and weakness. The nurse found the patient to be oriented but with new difficulty answering questions. The nurse found no objective evidence of arm weakness.

The nurse called the hospitalist to relay the new symptoms of arm weakness, along with her assessment that the patient had normal strength in her arm. She did not report the new speech difficulty. The hospitalist asked the nurse to call for a neurology consultation and told the nurse that he would come by to see the patient later.

Four hours later, the patient's weakness had progressed; she was now completely unable to move her right arm. The hospitalist had not yet evaluated the patient in person, and the neurology consultant also had not seen the patient. The nurse called the hospitalist and a stat CT head was ordered, which revealed large ischemic stroke. A Code Stroke was called. On review of telemetry, the patient was noted to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was felt to be the likely cause of her stroke.

The patient was urgently transferred to the ICU and received thrombolytic therapy, with some improvement in her symptoms. She was eventually discharged to a long-term facility for neurorehabilitation.

The telemetry floor charge nurse referred the case to the hospital's risk management department due to the delay in physician assessment. Formal review confirmed that the initial symptoms of arm weakness were not acted upon by the hospitalist, and that the patient had not been seen for more than 4 hours by either the hospitalist or neurologist despite the new symptoms. The telemetry tracing had also not been formally reviewed by a physician.

Following this case, the hospitalist group instituted new policies mandating a face-to-face assessment by the hospitalist within 1 hour of patients being admitted to the floor and mandated that subspecialty consultants should be contacted directly by the hospitalist instead of by nursing staff.

================================================================================

Title: Adverse Event During Intrahospital Transport

The Case:
A 4-year-old boy underwent surgery under general anesthesia for correction of a congenital intestinal abnormality. The procedure was uneventful, and he was extubated in the operating room and brought to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient appeared stable in the PACU, but due to his age and length of the procedure, the PACU anesthesiologist ordered him to be placed on continuous pulse-oximetry monitoring for 24 hours.

The patient was deemed stable to leave the PACU and be transported to the regular floor. However, he was not placed on pulse oximetry during the transport itself, which took about 10 minutes. On arrival to the floor, the patient transporter brought the patient to the designated room and alerted nurses that he had placed a new patient from the PACU there. The transporter did not communicate any concerns about the patient to the nursing staff. The bedside nurse had received signout from the PACU that the procedure had been uncomplicated and the patient had done well, so she felt no urgency to assess the new arrival. A few minutes later, the nurse went to assess the patient. She placed him on pulse oximetry and immediately realized that he was markedly hypoxic. She immediately administered oxygen by face mask, but he quickly became bradycardic and hypotensive, and a Code Blue was called. The patient went into cardiac arrest. He was eventually resuscitated but was left with significant neurological injury as a result of hypoxic brain injury.

The hospital performed a root cause analysis of the case. The investigation found that the PACU staff understood the order for "continuous pulse oximetry for 24 hours" was to begin when the patient arrived on the ward. The patient's oxygen saturation had probably started to drop shortly before he left the PACU and had progressively worsened during transport, while he was not monitored. Had the patient been monitored during the transport, his deterioration might have been detected earlier. The transport staff member stated that he thought the patient might be experiencing breathing difficulty during the transport but did not voice his concern as he had been assured the boy was stable and he did not trust his own judgment.

================================================================================

Title: Triaging Interhospital Transfers

The Case:
A 63-year-old man with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes was evaluated by his primary care physician for a rash. The physician noted the presence of high fevers and headache, and so he sent the patient to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation and possible admission. Repeat vital signs in the ED were notable for a slightly low blood pressure and elevated respiratory rate. His rash was worsening, with sloughing of his skin. Laboratory test results showed an elevated lactate and white blood cell count, both concerning for possible sepsis. Fluids and antibiotics were administered. The patient was started on IV norepinephrine through a peripheral IV to maintain his blood pressure, but no central line was placed.

The admitting physician was concerned that the patient might require subspecialty care, including dermatology consultation and critical care interventions not available at the local hospital. The physician arranged to have the patient transferred to a large academic medical center that could provide these services, but he was not familiar with any formal process to do so. He called a colleague at the receiving hospital to make the request for transfer. The colleague secured a bed through the bed control department and suggested he send the patient over.

The details of the patient's current clinical condition and clinical data were not formally transmitted to the receiving hospital. Not knowing that the patient required pressors to maintain his blood pressure and that he was likely developing worsening shock, the accepting physician booked a general ward bed for the patient rather than an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. He did not inform the hospital's transfer center.

Four hours later, the patient arrived at the academic medical center and was placed on a telemetry floor. His mentation was altered and he was breathing rapidly. The bedside nurse realized that norepinephrine was infusing through a peripheral IV. He called the rapid response team and ICU fellow to arrange for transfer to the ICU. Unfortunately, in the interim, the patient went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead about an hour after transfer.

In reviewing the case, the accepting physician was not aware of how critically ill the patient had become prior to transfer and did not have access to laboratory and imaging data from the referring institution. The ambulance transport team was not trained to provide critical care and did not recognize that the patient's condition was deteriorating quickly while en route.

================================================================================

Title: One Bronchoscopy, Two Errors

The Case:
A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. For his severe hypoxia, he was managed with high-flow nasal cannula and did not require mechanical ventilation. He was given intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

On the second hospital day, the patient had increased pulmonary secretions. The critical care provider decided to perform bronchoscopy at the bedside. After informed consent and a procedural time out, the patient was given 2 mg of intravenous midazolam, a sedating agent. Once he was lightly sedated, a flexible bronchoscope was introduced.

The airways were inspected throughout. Then, per usual protocol, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by introducing 20 mL of normal saline to the right middle lobe. This fluid was suctioned out and sent to the laboratory for analysis.

The bronchoscope was removed without any complications. However, the patient was difficult to arouse after the procedure. This was unexpected given that only a small amount of midazolam had been used. The patient was nearly apneic with very shallow breaths and the decision was made to intubate. The patient did not need any further sedation during the intubation.

The entire care team paused in real time to review the events. The critical care provider noticed that the syringes that contained the different fluids were not labeled and were both stored on the same shelf of the procedure cart. It was discovered that after the 2 mg of intravenous midazolam was given, instead of flushing this with normal saline, it had been flushed with an additional 10 mg of midazolam (the nurse had flushed with 2 mL and the midazolam concentration was 5 mg/mL). This high dose of midazolam had led to the respiratory failure requiring intubation.

On top of that, instead of normal saline, lidocaine had been used for the lung lavage. The lidocaine was available in a syringe for the bronchoscopy, as occasionally patients have severe discomfort or coughing from the bronchoscope and the lidocaine can be used to treat this. The lidocaine syringe was also not labeled and was sitting next to the syringe with normal saline. Fortunately, the patient did not experience any adverse consequences from the use of the lidocaine for the lavage (high doses of lidocaine can enter the systemic circulation and lead to neurological and cardiovascular adverse effects).

The patient remained intubated until the midazolam wore off. He woke up and was able to be extubated safely later that day. He slowly improved with treatment of his pneumonia and went home a few days later. The care team disclosed the errors to the patient including a commitment to making improvements to prevent such an error in the future.

================================================================================

Title: Critical Order Set Change and Critical Limb Ischemia

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease presented with acute limb ischemia secondary to thrombosis of her left superficial femoral artery. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed almost immediately upon arrival to the hospital. The patient was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit with the catheter device in place.

Per protocol, the admitting resident ordered a heparin drip to prevent thrombosis of the catheter and sheath site. The resident was unaware that the heparin drip order set in the electronic medical record had undergone significant revision and now contained dosing and monitoring options. Because of this change, the resident inadvertently ordered a heparin dose that was too low. The bedside nurse and the pharmacist noticed the low dose, but they assumed that the resident had purposefully selected the dose from the range of options provided in the order set.

As a result, the patient was inadequately anticoagulated. Twelve hours later, she developed extensive thrombosis associated with the catheter and sheath site that extended to the bifurcation of the aorta. The patient ultimately required surgical intervention for critical limb ischemia, including amputation of the contralateral leg above the knee, due to prolonged time without adequate blood flow.

================================================================================

Title: Spotlight: Mistaken Attribution, Diagnostic Misstep

The Case:
A 45-year-old woman with history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia presented to the emergency department (ED) with active paranoid hallucinations. In the ED, she was afebrile but had mild tachycardia and a few transient hypoxic episodes. Over the course of a few hours, the hypoxia resolved but the tachycardia persisted. Her agitation and hallucinations impaired her ability to communicate or answer review of systems questions.

The on-call psychiatry resident evaluated the patient and felt she needed hospitalization in the inpatient psychiatric facility. He attributed the persistent tachycardia and the transient hypoxia to her underlying agitation.

The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric facility, and treatment was initiated for agitation and hallucinations. Over the next few days, she required multiple different medications, including benzodiazepines and mood stabilizers (olanzapine), to control her symptoms. These medications caused somnolence and drowsiness, so the patient was bedbound most of the day. She had persistent tachycardia over these few days that continued to be attributed to her agitation and psychiatric disease.

On the morning of hospital day 5, the nurse found the patient to be unresponsive. She had a fever, worsening tachycardia (heart rate 140s), tachypnea, and more severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation 80% on room air). On examination, she had diffuse myoclonus and increased muscle tone. She was barely arousable and confused, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the regular hospital.

After an evaluation by the critical care provider, a CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli that were felt to explain the ongoing tachycardia and hypoxia. She was also diagnosed with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare and life-threatening reaction to some psychiatric medications. It is characterized by fever, muscular rigidity, myoclonus, and altered mental status, all of which were present in this patient. She was treated with heparin for the pulmonary embolism and supportive care and she slowly improved. After 4 days in the ICU, she was transferred to a regular medical ward. A few days later, she was able to be transferred back to the inpatient psychiatric facility.

A formal root cause analysis of the case found many errors that led to the adverse events. The director of the inpatient psychiatric unit used the case as an opportunity to broadly consider not only medical complications but all of the patient safety issues involving the unit.

================================================================================

Title: Inadequate Preanesthetic Evaluation, Airway Trouble

The Case:
Case #1:

A 34-year-old woman was scheduled for a hysteroscopy under general anesthesia. She was morbidly obese but otherwise healthy. The morning gynecology surgery list was overbooked with five cases, a mixture of ambulatory cases and inpatient cases. On arrival at the patient's cubicle, the anesthesiologist found the curtain was drawn around the patient's bed, and she was donning a hospital gown. The anesthesiologist waited for 5 minutes, but as he had other patients to see, he left without performing the preoperative assessment. Once she was taken to the operating room, the anesthesiologist discovered from chart review that the patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux. After induction of general anesthesia, the patient could be ventilated but her trachea could not be intubated. A supraglottic airway was successfully placed, and surgery proceeded uneventfully under general inhalation anesthesia. The patient had a bruised upper airway, which caused her some discomfort, but she otherwise recovered and was discharged home later that day.

Case #2:

A 76-year-old man with recurrent lymphoma and an oral tumor mass at the base of the tongue was booked for a biopsy of this mass under general anesthesia. The patient had a history of hypertension treated with amlodipine. He had not been seen in a preanesthetic assessment clinic. On the day of the surgery, the patient was conscious, alert, and oriented without any stridor or breathlessness. An anesthesiologist came to examine the patient and could not see much of the mass with the patient sitting in a chair, opening his mouth maximally, and sticking out his tongue. The anesthesiologist was unable to locate the patient's head and neck CT scan to further evaluate the mass. The surgeon arrived late and did not communicate about the patient with the anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist induced general anesthesia, but laryngoscopy and intubation proved extremely difficult as the posterior tongue mass, the size of a small lemon, obscured the view of the larynx. The anesthesiologist kept the patient oxygenated and asleep while attempting to use a fiberoptic bronchoscope to intubate the patient. Another anesthesiologist was called, and together they were able to intubate him with the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The biopsy of the tongue mass was obtained, and the patient was extubated and discharged home later that day.

================================================================================

Title: Written Signout: It Only Works If You Use The Right One

The Case:
A 75-year-old man was hospitalized due to a stroke. During the hospitalization, he experienced significant difficulty swallowing, which resulted in an aspiration pneumonia. He then developed hypernatremia (high blood sodium levels) requiring close monitoring and treatment with IV fluids.

The patient was hospitalized at an academic hospital early in the academic year. At this institution, all housestaff received training in safe handoffs using a standardized, validated tool (I-PASS), and the electronic health record (EHR) had a dedicated signout template. However, the primary intern caring for the patient was on his first day of the rotation, as was the night cross-cover intern. Before leaving for the day, the primary intern reviewed the overnight plan with his senior resident and attempted to update the signout template in the EHR. He then verbally signed out to the cross-cover intern, asking her to check the patient's sodium level and replete the patient with IV fluids if the sodium was elevated. The cross-cover intern asked for more specific directions around managing the patient's sodium, and the primary intern assured her that the necessary information was in the written signout. The cross-cover intern was already very busy receiving signout from other interns, so she did not specifically review the detailed written instructions with the primary intern.

Later that evening, the patient's sodium level test result returned at 144 mmol/L (the upper limit of normal). The cross-cover intern checked the written signout, which stated "If Na >142 then give 1 liter half normal saline." The cross-cover intern reviewed this plan with her supervising resident, who agreed; she then wrote an order to give the IV fluids as instructed.

The following morning, the primary team returned and received signout from the cross-cover intern. The primary team's senior resident expressed surprise when she was told that IV fluids had been started overnight and remarked, "He was getting volume overloaded yesterday, so we didn't want any fluids started unless he was definitely hypernatremic. A sodium of 144 mmol/L is fine—you shouldn't have done anything." The cross-cover intern was confused and pointed out that she had followed the written signout instructions. On reviewing the written signout, the primary intern realized that he had accidentally printed a copy of the previous day's signout—it had not been updated. The sodium management plan had actually been changed, but this was not reflected in the printed written signout.

Fortunately, the patient did not experience any adverse consequences as a result of the error. After reviewing the incident, the residency program decided that a senior resident should review the written signout and should be present when interns sign out to each other for the first 3 months of the academic year.

================================================================================

Title: Supervision and Entrustment in Clinical Training: Protecting Patients, Protecting Trainees

The Case:
A 65-year-old man was admitted with head and spine trauma after falling from a tree while doing yard work. He presented with poor neurologic function requiring mechanical ventilation. A CT scan of the head and neck showed hemorrhage in his brainstem and cervical spinal cord, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the ICU, his hemorrhage led to hemodynamic instability, including fluctuating blood pressures and intermittent bradycardia with heart rates as low as 20–30 beats per minute.

The decision was made to obtain a brain and spine MRI. Given the patient's critical condition, hospital policy dictated that he be accompanied by a nurse and a physician to the MRI scanner, which was 10 floors below the ICU. The ICU attending assigned the intern to transport the patient with the bedside nurse. The intern was in his second month of internship, had never done an ICU rotation before, and had never been involved in the transport of a critically ill patient.

The patient was transported to the MRI scanner. Due to some logistical challenges, he was in a holding area for more than an hour. During that time, on two occasions the patient's heart rate fell to 20 beats per minute, associated with severe hypotension. The intern, who had not been given instructions on how to manage such a scenario, did not know how to respond. Fortunately, the ICU nurse was quite experienced and appropriately administered atropine, with recovery of the heart rate and blood pressure.

The patient was finally placed into the MRI machine safely. Shortly thereafter, a chief resident came down to the MRI scanner and informed the intern that he had to leave the patient to attend a mandatory conference. The intern was hesitant given the patient's severity of illness, but the chief resident insisted that he leave. The chief resident had identified a medical student to sit in the scanner with the patient. Fortunately, there were no other clinical issues, and the patient remained stable. The medical student remained for the 2-hour scan and helped transport the patient back upstairs. Ultimately, the patient was found to have catastrophic bleeding. After discussions with his family, care was withdrawn and he died peacefully.

A week later, the intern participated in a well-being session for housestaff and discussed the events. He expressed how he was incredibly uncomfortable and felt unequipped to handle the clinical situation. He felt that he had placed the patient's life at risk because of his inexperience. He also reflected that he did not feel comfortable stating his discomfort at the time as he feared he would be labeled as weak by the attending. In addition, he shared the distress he felt when the medical student was assigned to replace him at the patient's bedside—he recognized the student likely had similar insecurities, yet neither one of them felt comfortable saying anything. He also wondered why the nurses and technicians didn't ensure that a more qualified provider was involved.

================================================================================

Title: Coming Up Short: Maintaining Safety in the Face of Drug Shortages

The Case:
A 1-month-old preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was receiving the standard 500 mL bag of 0.45% sodium chloride (NaCl) with heparin at low rates to maintain IV line patency. The patient developed hyponatremia, and the clinicians recognized the need to deliver a more concentrated sodium solution with less free water. Therefore, the order was given to change the IV fluid to a 500 mL bag of 0.9% NaCl with heparin. However, due to a natural disaster affecting the manufacture and supply chain for IV fluids, very few 0.9% NaCl 500 mL bags were available in the region. The hospital and clinical team were asked to conserve the supply and use alternatives wherever possible, so the order was modified to use 100 mL 0.9% NaCl bags, which were available.

Since the total volume was much smaller, a lower concentration formulation of heparin was required: 100 units/mL compared to the usual concentration of 1000 units/mL. However, the verifying pharmacist discovered that the wrong concentration (1000 units/mL) had been used to compound the fluids. Further investigation revealed that this error had occurred on five other occasions, each committed by different technicians. Fortunately, because a minimal amount of heparin and fluid were infused each day, the error did not adversely affect this patient (or the others). However, the error did lead to the performance of additional blood tests (mostly activated partial thromboplastin time measures).

================================================================================

Title: Diffusion of Responsibility Leads to Danger

The Case:
A 70-year-old man was sent to the emergency department (ED) from a nursing facility due to decreased oral intake, fevers, confusion, and falling urine output. On initial evaluation, he was found to be somnolent but arousable on deep stimulation. Laboratory test results revealed acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a serum creatinine of 12.0 mg/dL and potassium of 7.3 mmol/L. The patient's electrocardiogram showed tall T waves, potentially a precursor of a dangerous arrhythmia due to the hyperkalemia.

The emergency physician initiated medical treatment for the hyperkalemia and consulted the on-call intensivist and nephrologist. The intensivist and nephrologist agreed that the patient required urgent hemodialysis to correct his metabolic abnormalities. The nephrologist asked the intensivist to serially monitor the patient's electrolytes and volume status, continue medical treatment of hyperkalemia, and place a hemodialysis catheter. The nephrologist planned to start dialysis as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, the intensive care unit (ICU) was full and the patient was forced to "board" in the ED. The intensivist was busy with other patients but came down to the ED and placed the dialysis catheter after a few hours. Repeat laboratory test results again demonstrated severe hyperkalemia with persistent electrocardiogram changes. The patient remained confused, likely due to uremia. The emergency physician spoke with the intensivist, who reassured her that the nephrologist had evaluated the patient and that dialysis would be initiated as soon as possible.

On arrival to the ICU approximately 5 hours after the initial labs, the patient was now hypotensive and essentially unarousable. The ICU nurse placed the patient on a cardiac monitor and immediately noticed a sine wave—a dangerous arrhythmia characteristic of severe hyperkalemia. The intensivist came to the bedside promptly, but the patient rapidly went into cardiac arrest. He was intubated and given urgent treatment for hyperkalemia, with restoration of sinus rhythm. At that point, the nephrologist arrived at the bedside and was surprised to find that the patient's hemodialysis had not been started. It turned out that the dialysis nurse had been told to start dialysis after the patient was physically in the ICU and was unaware of the urgency of the situation.

Fortunately, the patient was resuscitated quickly. Hemodialysis was urgently started. The patient did not experience any neurologic consequences from the cardiac arrest and was able to be extubated and transferred to the ward within a few days. He was eventually discharged on hospital day 7 to continue outpatient hemodialysis.
