Title: Spotlight: Overdiagnosis and Delay: Challenges in Sepsis Diagnosis

The Case:
A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized weakness and nausea. He was noted to be confused but protecting his airway. His blood pressure was low (80/50 mm Hg), and he was started on intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics with some initial improvement in his symptoms and blood pressure. Laboratory test results revealed a mildly elevated white count, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver function tests. CT scans of his head and abdomen were ordered, and he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) with a presumed diagnosis of septic shock.

The patient's blood pressure continued to trend downward to 60/40 mm Hg. Physicians placed a central line and started him on vasopressors. In reviewing the laboratory tests ordered in the ED, the ICU resident noticed that the patient's troponin level had returned markedly elevated. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) from the ED revealed some T-wave inversions. A repeat ECG in the ICU showed obvious ST segment elevations suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). At that point, the ICU physicians came to believe that a large AMI was the likely explanation for the patient's low blood pressure on presentation, not septic shock.

The patient was immediately sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. He was found to have complete occlusion of the right coronary artery and a stent was placed to alleviate the blockage. He required ionotropic support to maintain cardiac output and was transferred to the coronary care unit in critical condition. He continued to deteriorate and ultimately experienced a cardiac arrest. He could not be revived and died 12 hours after presenting to the ED.

In the end, clinicians realized that the patient had initially been misdiagnosed with sepsis and that his presenting symptoms and exam findings were most likely caused by AMI and cardiogenic shock. Had the correct diagnosis been made earlier, the outcome might have been different.

Title: The Wrong Blade: A Lack of Familiarity With Pediatric Emergency Equipment

The Case:
As part of aprospective multicenter cohort study, 58 interprofessional teams—each comprised of 1–2 physicians, 3–5 nurses, and 2–3 nursing assistants or emergency medical technician personnel—were evaluated in their native pediatric or general emergency department (ED) resuscitation bays as they managed a series of 3 simulated critically ill patients (sepsis, seizure, and cardiac arrest). The simulated cardiac resuscitation case was a 5-year-old boy, found pulseless and apneic in the bathtub by a parent. All of the teams used the Broselow system, a proprietary system designed to facilitate finding the appropriate-sized resuscitation equipment for ill and injured children requiring lifesaving interventions.

In the simulation case reviews, it was noted that many of the teams had difficulty with the resuscitation because of a lack of interoperability between the prestocked disposable laryngoscope blades and handles on the Broselow cart with the ED's actual stock of blades and handles. This incompatibility led to significant delays in intubation; at times, it led to actual failure to intubate. For example, the teams, who usually did not recognize the problem with compatibility, spent unnecessary time replacing batteries and the like. Some called for backup airway teams, resulting in delays in treatment. If this case were to actually occur, it is likely that many of the teams would have made significant errors in handling the intubation equipment that would likely have led to patient harm or even death.

================================================================================

Title: Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards

The Case:
A 67-year-old woman with cancer was admitted to the hospital to begin a chemotherapy cycle of IV etoposide (daily for 3 days) and IV cisplatin (a single dose). The chemotherapy order was sent to the hospital's cancer center satellite pharmacy, where the pharmacist entered the order into the computer. She prepared the first doses of etoposide and cisplatin, which were scheduled for administration on a Friday.

Inadvertently, while transcribing the order, the pharmacist switched the duration of therapy for the two agents, entering a single dose of etoposide and 3 days of cisplatin therapy. The patient received the correct doses on the first day (since the transposition didn't affect this); however, the subsequent days' doses were incorrect. The second day of therapy fell on a Saturday, and the satellite pharmacy was closed for the weekend. Doses for day 2 of therapy were therefore prepared in a different pharmacy, by a pharmacist who did not have access to the original chemotherapy order. The weekend pharmacist instead received a computer-generated label for cisplatin, verified the dose was appropriate for the patient's body surface area, and prepared the dose without realizing the patient had already received cisplatin the day before. Thus, cisplatin was labeled and dispensed according to the incorrectly transcribed order.

When the dose reached the bedside, the patient's nurse was in a hurry and bypassed the double-check policy of having a second nurse verify the chemotherapy order prior to administration. The nursing and pharmacy medication profiles were actually on different systems, so the nursing profile reflected the original correct order while the pharmacy profile reflected the incorrectly transcribed order. The patient ultimately received a second dose of cisplatin instead of the intended dose of etoposide.

Immediately after the cisplatin had been administered, the nurse reread the original order, recognized the error, and contacted the pharmacy and physician. In subsequent days, the patient's renal function began to deteriorate, and she required hemodialysis several times during the hospitalization. Luckily, the patient recovered and no longer needed dialysis by the time of discharge.

In response to the event, the hospital established a policy requiring original chemotherapy orders to be used as a double check following initial doses and reviewed strategies to improve interoperability of the technology involved in the processing and administration of chemotherapy orders.

================================================================================

Title: Steroids and Safety: Preventing Medication Adverse Events During Transitions of Care

The Case:
A 73-year-old woman with a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain was admitted to the hospital with a few weeks of cough and generalized weakness. After a complete evaluation, she was found to have multiple medical issues including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP pneumonia), invasive pulmonary aspergillus, diffuse myopathy (muscle weakness), and gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcer disease.

During medication reconciliation, it was discovered that 2 months prior to this illness, the patient had been prescribed dexamethasone (4 mg every 6 hours, equivalent to ~100 mg of prednisone per day, a very high dose of steroids) to reduce the brain swelling associated with the cancer. The intention had been to taper off the steroids a few weeks later, after she received radiotherapy for her brain metastases. However, the corticosteroids were never tapered, and she had continued to take high-dose steroids for more than 2 months.

The hospitalist, oncologist, and endocrinologist all believed that all of her acute issues were a result of the steroids. She was treated with antibiotics, the steroids were tapered, and she had no further gastrointestinal bleeding. However, because of the multiple complications, she required hospitalization for more than a week and was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for ongoing physical therapy. She remained at the nursing facility for more than 2 months before returning home.

A formal case review identified several issues that led to the errors and adverse events. Multiple providers were involved in her care (oncologist, radiation oncologist, primary care provider), and no one took ownership over the dexamethasone prescription. The patient lived far away from the hospital where she was receiving care. The patient and family spoke predominantly Tagalog, and there may have been miscommunication related to the language discordance.

The hospitalist caring for the patient wondered about the frequency of errors and adverse events related to corticosteroids and what individuals and institutions could do to prevent these errors.

================================================================================

Title: Mixup Beyond the Medication Label

The Case:
An 80-year-old man was admitted to a hospital for recurrent hypoglycemia. He had been seen at another hospital 2 weeks earlier for a similar episode, with a glucose level of 26 mg/dL. He was treated and released without a diagnosis at that time. Despite extensive diagnostic workup during the current admission, physicians could not identify the cause of hypoglycemia. Once his glucose level normalized, he was discharged home.

Approximately 2 weeks after the second discharge, the patient experienced another severe hypoglycemic episode and was admitted to a different hospital. At this time, his glucose level was 36 mg/dL; concurrent insulin level was 36.7 mIU/L (normal fasting level

However, the consulting endocrinologist recommended the family bring in all of the patient's medication bottles. The family returned with 12 different medications, none of which were labeled as an oral hypoglycemic agent. The resident used the codes on each pill to identify them and discovered that one bottle labeled as "doxazosin (Cardura)" actually contained the sulfonylurea, glimepiride (Amaryl) 4 mg. The patient had no history of diabetes, which likely suggested a pharmacy filling error. He had no further hypoglycemic episodes once this error was identified and corrected.

================================================================================

Title: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening

The Case:
A 76-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease (status post prior coronary artery bypass grafting), severe heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and an extensive smoking history was admitted to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath. As part of his medical evaluation, he underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram that demonstrated severe aortic stenosis, felt to be the likely cause of his shortness of breath and worsening heart failure. The cardiology team was consulted and recommended cardiac catheterization to further assess the patient's condition. However, when the interventional cardiologist performed the catheterization, she could not advance the catheter and an aortogram revealed that the patient had an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring almost 9 cm in diameter.

Given the size of the AAA and the high risk of rupture, the patient was sent emergently for surgical repair. His postoperative course was complicated by multiple strokes, a myocardial infarction requiring repeat catheterization, and a catheter-associated urinary tract infection. He was discharged from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility several weeks after surgery. Because of his multiple comorbid medical conditions, he was deemed not to be a candidate for aortic valve replacement. He died 5 months later in hospice care.

================================================================================

Title: An Untimely End Despite End-of-Life Care Planning

The Case:
A 76-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a cardiac arrest and loss of cardiac function for about 15 minutes. Afterward, the patient displayed worsening neurological status and a CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema and anoxic injury. The ICU team initiated conversation with the patient's family to establish goals of care.

After extensive discussions, the family agreed to a DNR [do not resuscitate] order for the patient, but they wanted more time before making a decision about transitioning to comfort care. The patient continued to decline, with loss of brain stem reflexes. After another week of conversations with the ICU team, including consultation from the palliative care service, the family decided to discontinue life-sustaining therapies and agreed to comfort measures and terminal extubation. Orders were written and the respiratory therapist and the patient's nurse were informed.

However, within a half hour of these actions, the family asked to speak with the ICU resident, reversed their prior decision, and stated that they wanted more time before transitioning to comfort measures. The ICU resident, who had been involved in the prior conversations, canceled the terminal extubation orders. However, this occurred at the end of shift, and the resident did not verbally communicate the order change to other members of the team. Another nurse who had been involved in the previous conversations found the canceled orders after the resident left, thought this was an error, and asked another physician, who was also unaware of the change in plans, to reinstate the terminal extubation orders. The patient was extubated. When the patient's daughter arrived shortly thereafter, she was very upset to find her father extubated. Eventually, the senior ICU team members were able to intervene and speak with the daughter to explain and apologize for the lack of communication. The patient died within few hours.

================================================================================

Title: Primary Workaround, Secondary Complication

The Case:
A young adult with a progressive neurological disorder presented to a hospital emergency department (ED) from a nursing home with a dislodged gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube. The patient had a history of multiple GJ tube dislodgements over the prior several months. When the GJ tube was dislodged, nursing home staff inserted a Foley catheter into the ostomy and inflated the Foley bulb in the stomach to maintain patency. The distal portion of the Foley catheter was tied in a loose knot but not otherwise secured (Figure 1). The catheter was in place on arrival to the ED. When the patient was taken to interventional radiology for GJ tube placement (Figure 2), there was no Foley noted; a new GJ tube was successfully inserted.

The patient was discharged back to the nursing home but readmitted 2 days later with fever and increasing abdominal distention. An abdominal CT scan showed an obstructing foreign body in the small bowel, initially thought to be a retained segment of the previously dislodged GJ tube. Surgical consultation was obtained, but nonsurgical intervention was recommended due to the patient's neurological condition. The patient continued to deteriorate despite volume resuscitation, broad spectrum antibiotics, and attempts to reduce the small bowel obstruction nonsurgically. After discussion with the patient's family, comfort measures were instituted on the fourth hospital day, and the patient died shortly thereafter.

The patient's family requested an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death. At autopsy, the entire Foley catheter—with inflated balloon and distal knot—was found to be obstructing the small bowel (Figure 3). The catheter appeared to have been pulled into the small bowel by peristalsis.

A root cause analysis (RCA) revealed several missed opportunities to have prevented the patient's unfortunate outcome. First, when the Foley catheter was initially inserted through the ostomy and inflated, the potential for peristalsis to pull the Foley catheter bulb into the stomach despite the distal loose knot was not adequately considered. A more appropriate method would have been a T-clamp or similar device instead of a loose knot to secure the catheter. Second, when the patient arrived in the ED, an opportunity to further secure the Foley catheter externally was missed. Third, when the patient was in interventional radiology and the Foley catheter was not in place, an opportunity to search for the Foley catheter was missed. It was assumed that the Foley had been removed pending the procedure. Finally, the radiologist did not consider that the obstructing body might be the Foley catheter and not the retained segment of the previously dislodged GJ tube.

The results of the RCA were disclosed to the patient's family. Although they were grateful that a thorough analysis had been performed and measures would be implemented to prevent these errors, they remained concerned about the decision to insert a Foley catheter through the GJ tube site. Since this took place at the nursing home, it fell outside the hospital RCA's jurisdiction. However, hospital safety leaders realized that this practice was common for hospitalized patients as well, potentially putting many patients at risk.

================================================================================

Title: Don't Pick the PICC

The Case:
A 63-year-old man with diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy; glaucoma; and stage IV chronic kidney disease was admitted to the hospital with an ulcer on the bottom of his right foot. Physical examination revealed a 2 cm clean-based ulcer below the fifth metatarsal head of the right foot. No surrounding swelling or erythema was present, but the ulcer could be probed to the underlying bone. An MRI was highly concerning for osteomyelitis, and a bone biopsy showed chronic inflammation with cultures positive for methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus. An infectious diseases consultant recommended therapy with 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone to be given via outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy.

The interventional radiology team was consulted to place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for antibiotic therapy. They attempted the placement multiple times in the right brachial vein but failed. The line was then successfully placed in the left brachial vein. The patient's nephrologist was not consulted prior to placing the PICC line. The patient was discharged and completed 6 weeks of antibiotics and wound care, with healing of the osteomyelitis and ulcer. The PICC line was then removed.

Five months later, the patient was seen by his nephrologist and was found to have worsening renal function and hyperphosphatemia. Dialysis access planning was initiated, but unfortunately, when the patient was evaluated by a vascular surgeon, he was found not be a candidate for arteriovenous fistula placement (the safest and most effective form of dialysis access). He was thought to have poor vein quality due to the many venipuncture attempts during the PICC line placements several months previously. Instead of a fistula, the patient had an arteriovenous graft placed, and dialysis was initiated 3 months later.

The patient's nephrologist referred the case to interventional radiology and hospital medicine for review given the preventable complication. The groups collaborated to develop a protocol to review renal function in patients who have requests for PICC lines, with nephrology approval required before any long-term venous access can be placed in patients with stage III–V chronic kidney disease.

================================================================================

Title: Perils in Diagnosing a Stroke

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic back pain, and opioid use disorder was brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive. The patient's wife had been driving him back from the store when she noticed he was very lethargic. After he became unresponsive, she called 911. In the emergency department, the physician suspected a stroke given the patient's risk factors and the relatively acute onset of symptoms. A CT scan revealed no bleeding into the brain. After consulting with a neurologist, the decision was made to give systemic thrombolytics (drugs to dissolve a blood clot).

After the thrombolytic was administered, the patient's nurse noticed multiple patches on the patient's back. She realized that they were fentanyl patches—a potent opioid medication. She spoke with the patient's wife, who said that the patient was prescribed the patches for his chronic back pain and that she had placed two fentanyl patches on the patient earlier that morning. The patient's wife stated his physician had recently increase the dose due to his pain level. The nurse asked a pharmacy technician to perform medication reconciliation, which revealed that the patient's fentanyl patch had recently been increased from 100 micrograms per hour to 150 micrograms per hour. However, his wife had accidentally applied two 150 microgram patches that morning—instead of one—as she assumed the two patches would be his new regimen. Therefore, the patient had inadvertently received three times his previous dose of fentanyl.

The nurse alerted the physician, who realized that the opioid overdose probably explained the patient's symptoms. He quickly ordered administration of naloxone (an opioid reversal agent). Although the patient initially became more responsive, shortly thereafter he had a generalized seizure. A repeat CT scan showed intracranial hemorrhage—an adverse consequence of the thrombolytics. His neurologic status deteriorated, and he required urgent surgery to drain the bleeding. The patient had a long, complex hospital course, but eventually he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with substantial (though not complete) recovery of his functional status.

================================================================================

Title: Febrile Neutropenia and an Almost Fatal Medication Error

The Case:
A 33-year-old woman with recently diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia was admitted to the oncology service for treatment with chemotherapy. She reported feeling relatively well, apart from mild fatigue secondary to anemia. For chronic constipation, she took sennosides daily and polyethylene glycol as needed.

On admission to the hospital, her vital signs were stable, and physical examination was notable only for conjunctival pallor. Chemotherapy was administered as scheduled over 5 days. As expected, her blood counts dropped in response to the chemotherapy, and on hospital day 6 she was noted to be neutropenic with an absolute neutrophil count of 320. That night, she noted some abdominal discomfort. The bedside nurse noted that the patient had not had a bowel movement for the last 2 days despite taking both sennosides and polyethylene glycol daily. The nurse paged the overnight physician, who ordered a suppository without realizing that the patient was neutropenic and immunosuppressed after recent chemotherapy. The nurse administered the suppository as ordered, unaware that suppositories are contraindicated in neutropenic patients.

Several hours later, the patient felt warm and developed shaking chills. Repeat vital signs revealed a fever to 39.7°C and a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, concerning for sepsis. The nurse paged the overnight physician once again. Blood cultures were drawn and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started for febrile neutropenia. The patient worsened clinically and required transfer to the intensive care unit for hypotension and management of septic shock. Her blood cultures ultimately grewEscherichia coli, which may have spread from her bowel to her bloodstream as a result of receiving the suppository. Ultimately, she recovered and was discharged home a week later.

================================================================================

Title: Chest Pain in a Rural Hospital

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with a history of diabetes presented to a rural emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain, hiccups, and generalized weakness. His vital signs were within normal limits, and physical examination was unremarkable. His initial electrocardiogram revealed an incomplete left bundle branch block. Laboratory results were notable for a blood sugar of 615 mg/dL, an anion gap acidosis, and a troponin of 1.8 μg/L (normal < 0.05 μg/L). The ED provider felt this presentation was consistent with a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state from poor adherence and that the patient should be admitted to the hospital.

As this was a rural hospital with 35 inpatient beds, there was no on-site provider to admit the patient overnight. The ED physician called the internist who was covering this hospital (and another rural hospital) and discussed the admission. The internist was concerned about the elevated troponin and possible myocardial ischemia, and he ordered aspirin and a heparin drip from home. These orders were not communicated to the nurse or the physician in the ED. Due to the configuration of the electronic health record, the ED nurse did not see the orders and neither medication was given. The internist's plan was to contact the local cardiologist who would be available the next day.

The patient was transferred to an acute care bed 2 hours later. When he arrived, he was diaphoretic, somnolent, tachycardic, and borderline hypotensive. The nurse called the covering internist at home about the situation, and the internist ordered more laboratory tests (including a troponin I) and inquired about the heparin drip. The nurse realized that the drip had never been started and called the pharmacy to clarify the dosing. When she went to administer the heparin, she found the patient to be unresponsive, hypotensive, and bradycardic. She called a code blue, and resuscitation was initiated.

During the resuscitation, the repeat troponin I level returned at 42 μg/L, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The patient's initial presentation with chest pain and weakness was likely because of an acute myocardial infarction. Despite maximal efforts, the patient could not be resuscitated and died. An autopsy revealed an acute myocardial infarction and a rupture of the left ventricular free wall.

================================================================================

Title: Suicide Risk in the Hospital

The Case:
A 37-year-old woman with a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) after a suicide attempt. She overdosed on 3–4 tablets each of alprazolam (a sedative) and gabapentin (a pain medication) and then cut both of her forearms with a kitchen knife. Upon presentation to the ED, the patient endorsed active suicidality. She had no previous suicide attempts. Her physical examination was significant for a tearful, depressed affect and superficial lacerations to the bilateral forearms, including a 3 cm laceration on the left forearm.

The patient's left forearm laceration was sutured and bandaged with gauze padding. The patient was observed for a period of several hours postingestion, and she was evaluated by a psychiatrist who placed an involuntary legal hold due to high risk of self-harm. She was then transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit. On arriving to the unit, the patient asked to use the bathroom. She then unwrapped the gauze bandage from her wrist, wrapped it around her neck and over the shower bar in the bathroom, and attempted to hang herself.

Fortunately, a staff member heard a noise from the bathroom, immediately entered, and cut the gauze before the patient was seriously injured. The patient was transferred back to the ED, where she was found to have superficial abrasions to her neck but an otherwise normal physical exam. A CT scan of the head and cervical spine was obtained, which was normal. She was ultimately readmitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for further treatment of her depression and suicidality.

================================================================================

Title: Root Cause Analysis Gone Wrong

The Case:
A 42-year-old man with history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis was awaiting a kidney transplant. A suitable donor was identified, and the patient was taken to the operating room for the procedure. The surgery was uneventful, and the transplanted kidney was connected successfully. As the procedure was drawing to a close, the surgeon instructed the anesthesiologist to give 3000 units of intravenous heparin (an anticoagulant) as part of the standard protocol to prevent graft thrombosis.

The surgical team was preparing to close the incision when the clinicians noticed blood in the surgical field. They performed a careful search for bleeding, but did not find a clear source, and the bleeding continued to worsen. The patient's blood pressure began to drop, and transfusions were administered while the team tried to stop the bleeding. At that point, the anesthesiologist reviewed the medications and realized that he had accidentally administered 30,000 units of heparin—not 3000 units. He immediately administered protamine to reverse the anticoagulant effect. However, the persistent bleeding and hypotension had irreversibly damaged the transplanted kidney. The kidney was explanted, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in critical condition. The error was disclosed to the patient and his family, and he eventually recovered and was discharged home. He continued to receive hemodialysis while awaiting another transplant.

The hospital planned to perform a root cause analysis (RCA) to investigate the adverse event. The transplant surgeon was furious about the error and complained angrily to the operating room staff, chief of anesthesiology, and chief medical officer (CMO) about the "incompetence" that had resulted in the error. Although the hospital's patient safety officer attempted to conduct the RCA in a nonjudgmental fashion, she found it very difficult to focus the investigation on possible systems issues, as it seemed that all the personnel involved had already decided the anesthesiologist was to blame. The transplant surgeon was influential at the hospital, and under pressure from the CMO, the chief of anesthesiology decided to dismiss the anesthesiologist. The RCA was completed, but the conclusions focused only on the individual anesthesiologist, and no interventions to prevent similar errors or address systems issues were ever implemented.

================================================================================

Title: Walking Patient, Missing Drain

The Case:
A 43-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer was admitted to the hospital for an elective lumbar drain placement to treat hydrocephalus and elevated intracranial pressures. Because of the pressure on her brain, the patient had symptoms including mood changes, headaches, and appetite changes. Following the procedure, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring under the care of the ICU team and neurosurgery team. She made progress with recovery as expected and participated in physical therapy. On day 5 of her hospitalization, the physical therapist administered vigorous therapy (as prescribed) with the patient out of bed. The therapist returned the patient to bed at the end of the therapy session. While resting in bed after the session, the patient complained of headaches, decreased appetite, and worsening visual problems. Since the complaints were similar to the patient's symptoms on admission, which should have been addressed by the lumbar drain, the nurse attributed the patient's complaints to depression and took no action, allowing the patient to sleep and keeping unchanged the prescribed frequency of neuro checks every 6 hours while awake.



Early in the morning, the patient was found to be barely arousable. The nurse and the team then discovered that lumbar drain had dislodged and was now on the floor. A stat CT scan was ordered, which revealed extensive hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain was placed emergently at the bedside after securing the patient's airway. Eventually the patient had a new lumbar drain placement, with improvement of her mental status and other complaints. She was ultimately extubated and discharged to home.



================================================================================

Title: Air on the Side of Caution

The Case:
A young woman with morbid obesity was scheduled for cardiac catheterization to evaluate shortness of breath and chest pain. A decision was made to use a radial artery approach. Positioning the patient appropriately was challenging because she could not move easily. After multiple attempts, the team was able to access her radial artery. After the catheter was inserted, the patient began to experience increasing pain and pressure in both her arm and her chest. The team proceeded quickly with the procedure, but they hesitated to administer additional pain medication given the patient's body habitus and concern for respiratory suppression. Anesthesia was not consulted.

Review of the angiogram demonstrated the presence of an air embolism in the left coronary artery, caused by air being introduced into the patient's radial artery during the catheter insertion. It became clear that, because of the procedure's difficulty, the cardiac technician controlling the syringe for injecting dye failed to hold the syringe at the proper angle to prevent an air bubble from being introduced into the patient's vessel. When the air embolism was recognized, appropriate treatment protocols were implemented. The patient was ultimately transferred to a higher level of care, treated appropriately, and discharged from the hospital several days later.

Further review revealed that the team was under significant time pressure to perform the procedure, and many members were fatigued, as it had been a long day without breaks. Music playing in the background may also have created a distraction. In addition, during the procedure a Code Blue had been called in the room next door, which meant that several key personnel were not present for this patient's catheterization.

================================================================================

Title: When Patients and Providers Speak Different Languages

The Case:
A 56-year-old Spanish-speaking woman with a complicated medical history presented to the preoperative clinic for evaluation in advance of a scheduled elective total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. The electronic health record indicated that the patient required a Spanish interpreter to communicate with health care providers. A non–Spanish-speaking physician met the patient and discovered that no in-person interpreter had been booked in advance of the visit.

The provider attempted to use the clinic's phone interpreter services, but the phone reception in the exam room was poor and the interpreter and patient could not hear each other. The patient tried calling her husband to interpret, but he was unavailable. Eventually, a Spanish-speaking medical assistant was able to interpret for the visit. The provider learned that the patient was having symptoms concerning for unstable angina and determined that the patient would require additional cardiac testing before proceeding with the elective surgery. The visit had been booked for a 30-minute slot but took more than 75 minutes. The patient obtained the necessary cardiac follow-up and her surgery was rescheduled.

After the visit, the physician investigated the situation further and discovered that the interpreter phone line receiver was located at the opposite end of clinic, which likely explained the poor reception in the exam rooms. Additionally, the interpreter phone shared a line with the fax machine. Although the physician had previously been able to use her personal cellphone to access the interpreter services company, the practice had recently switched vendors and she did not have their access number. Furthermore, the clinic did not have a formal process in place designed to identify non–English-speaking patients in advance of their visits and to ensure that in-person interpreters were booked for those visits.

================================================================================

Title: Missing ECG and Missed Diagnosis Lead to Dangerous Delay

The Case:
A 35-year-old woman with no prior cardiac history called 911 after developing severe chest pressure at home. Based on the availability of local resources, a Basic Life Support Unit was dispatched. When emergency medical services (EMS) arrived at the patient's home, EMS providers obtained a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and administered aspirin. The ECG tracing showed ST elevations consistent with a large anterior wall myocardial infarction, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). According to protocol, EMS providers were required to transmit the ECG to the emergency department (ED) to activate "Code STEMI" while en route so that the cardiac catheterization laboratory, as well as necessary cardiology providers and staff, would be ready to treat the patient upon arrival to the hospital. Unfortunately, the ECG was not successfully transmitted to the ED (for technical reasons), which meant that the STEMI team was not activated in advance of the patient's arrival.

When the patient arrived in the ED, the clinicians (unaware of the original ECG) obtained a new ECG, which did not demonstrate the previously noted ST segment elevations. The patient's chest pain also seemed to be improving. She was treated with opioids for mild ongoing pain, and no additional ECGs or laboratory tests were ordered. She was subsequently admitted to the inpatient telemetry floor for overnight monitoring. The next morning, the patient's laboratory test results were notable for an elevated troponin level, suggesting that significant myocardial damage had occurred. Repeat ECG showed findings consistent with a large heart attack the prior day. She was rushed to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because PCI had been delayed for many hours from the time of the original STEMI, the patient experienced significant loss of cardiac muscle function. She ultimately required placement of a device to assist her heart function and a prolonged stay in the cardiac intensive care unit.

================================================================================

Title: Shortcuts to Acetaminophen-induced Liver Failure

The Case:
An 18-year-old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, presented to the emergency department (ED) after a week of respiratory congestion, nausea, and fever. She was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory infection, given IV fluids and acetaminophen, and discharged home with advice to continue taking acetaminophen as needed to control the fever. Thirty hours later, the patient returned to the ED with continued symptoms and new abdominal cramps. She was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and discharged with ondansetron and bismuth subsalicylate. Two days later, she presented again to the ED, this time with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. She was admitted to the ward and physical examination revealed lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, and generalized abdominal tenderness. Influenza B polymerase chain reaction was positive and Oseltamivir was started. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, transaminitis in the thousands, and lactic acidosis. The patient was admitted to the hospital and given broad-spectrum antibiotics and a diagnosis of "influenza/possible sepsis." Further questioning revealed the patient had taken 1 g of acetaminophen every 4 hours since her initial ED visit. However, despite evidence of acute fulminant hepatitis due to chronic acetaminophen overdose, the antidote, N-acetylcysteine, was held for 10 hours because acetaminophen levels were less than 10 mcg/mL, deemed to be below the toxic level. The patient recovered over the next 24 hours with conservative management and N-acetylcysteine.

Title: Isolated Clot, Real Error

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman underwent an elective hysterectomy and had a complicated postoperative course, including excessive bleeding during the procedure. She was given multiple blood products and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She spiked a fever, and her temperature remained elevated through her sixth day in the intensive care unit (ICU). An extensive evaluation for infection failed to reveal a source.

On rounds, the team decided to order whole-leg Doppler ultrasounds of both lower extremities looking for a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as a cause of the fevers. That afternoon, the intern checked the results and noted the first line of the final result stated "Positive. Thrombosis of right lower extremity." Because she was trying to sign out at the end of the day, she did not read the entire report. No other provider reviewed the official results.

The next day on rounds, the intern reported to the rest of the ICU team that the ultrasound was positive for a DVT. Because of the patient's life-threatening postoperative bleeding, the team agreed the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation (the usual treatment for DVT). Instead, they ordered an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in the hopes that it would prevent a pulmonary embolism (PE). She tolerated the placement of the filter without complication.

The next week, a new team started in the ICU. They were reviewing the plan of care and discussed the reason for the IVC filter (an unusual intervention given recent studies questioning its overall benefit). The senior resident reviewed all of the radiology records and read the original ultrasound report, which did state there was a thrombosis in the right lower extremity, but went on to describe it as being localized to the great saphenous vein. This particular vein is considered a superficial vein, meaning that a clot in it carries very low risk for PE and should not have been treated with placement of an IVC filter. The team determined that the next step in management should have been active surveillance with repeat ultrasound.

The team recognized the error and disclosed it to the patient and family. The family was upset but understood the confusion. A repeat ultrasound of the right leg showed resolution of the thrombosis. The IVC filter was removed the following day without complication. The patient experienced no direct consequences from the placement of the IVC filter and slowly recovered over the next few weeks.

Title: Signout Fallout

The Case:
A 43-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation was brought to the hospital with altered mental status and found to have an intracranial mass with a surrounding hemorrhage. She was intubated for airway protection and managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). She was monitored clinically and with daily CT scans of the brain. Fortunately, for the first 3 days, her exam remained unchanged, and the bleeding was stable on repeated CT scans.

On hospital day 4, the ICU team and the neurosurgeon decided it would be safe to start deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. They collectively decided that, if the CT scan that day remained unchanged, the benefits of low-dose DVT prophylaxis would outweigh the risk of serious bleeding. The senior resident on the neurosurgical service told the intern during the day that "heparin should be started if the CT scan is unchanged," but didn't specify the dose or route of the heparin. The intern did not ask any follow-up questions about the plan. At the end of the day, the intern signed out to the overnight on-call resident to "start heparin if the CT scan is unchanged."

The on-call resident reviewed the CT scan with the radiology resident overnight and they agreed it was stable. He then briefly reviewed the records and saw the history of atrial fibrillation and decided the day team must have wanted to treat the patient with full-dose anticoagulation (rather than lower dose anticoagulation, appropriate for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis). He ordered full-dose anticoagulation with a heparin infusion.

About 2 hours after starting the infusion, the patient became more obtunded. A repeat head CT scan showed a significant increase in the intracranial hemorrhage and worsening brain compression. The heparin infusion was stopped, but the patient continued to worsen over the next few hours. Based on the extent of the bleeding and her neurologic examination, she had no chance for a meaningful recovery. After discussions with her family, care was withdrawn, and she died with her family at her bedside.

The neurosurgical attending and the ICU attending met with both of their teams to discuss what happened. They identified many errors but were particularly concerned about the miscommunication regarding what was signed out to the overnight provider. With their local graduate medical education office, they initiated a literature review and began quality improvement efforts to embrace best practices in signout.

================================================================================

Title: Right Place, Right Drug, Wrong Strength

The Case:
A 2-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital burn unit for a 10% total body surface area burn on her face, upper chest, and back. She was being treated with oral acetaminophen around the clock and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed for pain and discomfort. The patient underwent dressing changes and burn inspection every third day. On these days, she was also given oxycodone, which was highly effective and allowed her to rest the whole day.

One week into the hospital stay, the mother noticed the patient's breathing was very shallow after a dressing change. On examination, the patient was difficult to arouse and lethargic, and an arterial blood gas revealed CO2 retention and hypoxemia. While preparing to intubate, the physician reviewed that day's medications to identify possible causes of this sudden change in respiratory status. He discovered the patient had received oxycodone 3 times in less than 8 hours (1 dose prior to the dressing change and 2 doses after). The nurse checked the automated dispensing machine in which the oxycodone was stored and was surprised to find a higher concentration of oxycodone solution stored in place of the typical, lower concentration pediatric solution. Consequently, the dose administered to the patient was almost 5 times what was ordered.

After the physician and nurse recognized the error, the patient immediately received multiple doses of naloxone. Her breathing improved quickly, and intubation was avoided. The patient was monitored in the hospital for 1 week after the incident, did well, and was safely discharged home.

Root cause analysis (RCA) by the safety committee determined the higher concentration of oxycodone solution was incorrectly placed in the automated dispensing machine by a pharmacist who was working per diem. The RCA also found that the nurse did not check the concentration of the medication to be administered against the order written by the physician.

After the incident, multiple checkpoints were established in the pharmacy and a new protocol was established, with a special focus on pediatric medication doses. In-service training was provided to all the pharmacists, including those who work irregular shifts (e.g., overnight).

================================================================================

Title: Returning Home Safely

The Case:
A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after a fall at home resulting in a right humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation, as well as other injuries including a right knee contusion. During his admission, the patient underwent right shoulder reduction surgery with plan to keep his arm in a sling until reassessment in 1 month. Given the extent of his injuries and the need for ongoing physical therapy, the plan was made to admit the patient to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for continued rehabilitation.

The patient lived alone and had little social support. His primary care physician (PCP) suspected that the patient might have dementia, and the results of a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Kohlman Evaluation of Living Skills assessment performed during the hospitalization raised concerns about the patient's ability to continue to live independently in the community. The hospital's social worker started the process of applying for In-Home Supportive Services and Meals on Wheels, and referred the patient to a home care agency to provide home physical therapy and home nursing visits. However, the final arrangements for these services could not be completed before the patient was discharged, so the trauma team communicated these recommendations to the patient's PCP and the SNF in their discharge summary.

The patient was discharged home from the SNF after a 4-week stay. Three days later, his neighbor brought him to the clinic for an urgent appointment with his PCP. The patient appeared distressed and was complaining of right shoulder pain. His arm remained in a sling, and he was unclear about his medication regimen. His neighbor reported that the patient had not left his apartment since being discharged from the SNF because he was having difficulty climbing the stairs, and he appeared to lack access to food, medications, or transportation to his appointments. The PCP had not received any communication from the SNF about the patient's discharge.

Fortunately, the clinic's social worker followed up on the prior referrals and arranged a home nursing visit and transportation to future appointments. The neighbor also agreed to help with obtaining the patient's medications. The patient did not need to be readmitted to the hospital and was able to stay at home, but the PCP felt frustrated that the patient had not had a better discharge plan.

================================================================================

Title: A Costly Colonoscopy Leads to a Delay in Diagnosis

The Case:
A 50-year-old man presented to a primary care clinic to establish care, as he had recently switched health insurance. As part of age-appropriate cancer screening, the primary care provider ordered a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) to screen for colon cancer. When FIT returned positive, the physician called the patient to inform him of the results and explained that a colonoscopy was the appropriate next step in the diagnostic process. The medical assistant contacted the patient with instructions for scheduling the colonoscopy.

Two months later, the clinic's nurse called the patient to see if he had obtained the colonoscopy. The patient reported that he was unable to schedule the colonoscopy due to cost. His health insurance required a 30% copayment for the test, which amounted to $2000 out-of-pocket. The clinic instructed the patient to contact his insurance company again. The clinic nurse followed up with the patient a few months later. Although the patient had contacted the insurance company multiple times, he was repeatedly informed that he would be responsible for 30% of the cost. The primary care provider spoke with the clinic's social worker who assessed options for financial assistance but could not find any for which the patient was eligible.

Ultimately, the primary care provider called the insurance company directly and was informed that if the indication for the colonoscopy was changed fromdiagnostictopreventive(for screening purposes), the test would be 100% covered (the full cost of preventive colonoscopies is covered under the Affordable Care Act). Because the colonoscopy represented the second step in the colon cancer screening process after a positive FIT, the primary care provider changed the indication for the test and the patient was eventually able to obtain the colonoscopy without any out-of-pocket cost. Because the initial communication about the out-of-pocket cost was between the patient and insurance company, the patient did not know to inform the insurance company that the colonoscopy was for screening purposes (rather than diagnostic purposes, as initially coded by the primary care physician) and that the copayment should have been waived. The colonoscopy demonstrated colon cancer; the diagnosis was made more than 6 months after the positive FIT. Luckily, the delay had no impact on his clinical outcome.

================================================================================

Title: A Painful Medication Reconciliation Mishap

The Case:
A 56-year-old woman with a history of alcohol dependence was admitted to the hospital after falling while intoxicated. Prior to this episode, she had been taking naltrexone to treat her alcohol use disorder and had been sober for 3 months. After the fall, a CT scan revealed a fracture of the cervical spine, which required spinal fusion surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient's pain was severe and opioids were initiated for pain control. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) on a long-acting opioid twice a day with a short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain every 6 hours. On admission to the hospital, her naltrexone had been held in anticipation of the fact that she would require opioid therapy for pain control. However, the provider performing medication reconciliation at the SNF restarted her on her home dose of naltrexone (a powerful opioid antagonist), along with the newly prescribed opioid medications. The provider overrode the drug–drug interaction alert regarding the risk of simultaneously prescribing naltrexone and opioids.

While at the SNF, the patient continued to receive naltrexone daily in addition to high-dose opioids. Her pain worsened and remained uncontrolled for most of her time there. The providers at the SNF did not realize that, as a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, the naltrexone was blocking the effect of the opioids, thus explaining why her pain was uncontrolled. The patient was seen in the general medicine clinic for follow-up 3 weeks after being discharged from the SNF, and the medication error was quickly recognized. Her primary care physician instructed her to stop the naltrexone, to halve the total opioid dose to prevent an overdose, and to return to clinic for close follow-up in 2 days.

================================================================================

Title: Slow Down: Right Drug, Wrong Formulation

The Case:
A 65-year-old man presented to his primary care clinic for follow-up after a recent hospitalization for exacerbation of heart failure. His past medical history was significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. The physician noted the patient, once again, showed several other signs of decompensated heart failure and sent him back to the hospital for intravenous (IV) diuretic therapy and control of his atrial fibrillation. The admitting internal medicine resident, in concert with the cardiology consult team, initiated IV diuresis and restarted the patient's home beta-blocker and antihypertensive medications. The patient reportedly had not taken his beta-blocker in the 36 hours prior to admission. As the evening progressed, the patient developed increasing oxygen requirements, decreasing blood pressure, and worsening mental status. That night, he developed atrioventricular block, experienced a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest, and died.

As part of the clinical review process, the case was discussed in a morbidity and mortality conference. The review revealed the patient's home medication was metoprolol succinate 300 mg. Instead, metoprolol tartrate 300 mg was ordered on hospital admission and administered as a single dose. In the institution's computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, the first formulation of metoprolol to populate into the ordering field was "Metoprolol Tab," which the system defined as metoprolol tartrate. Metoprolol succinate populated as "Metoprolol *Do Not Crush* SA" with "SA" standing for "sustained action," not "short acting."

The ordering physician was clear in chart documentation that the intent was to start extended-release metoprolol. Thus, the ordering of metoprolol tartrate at that dose was a prescribing error believed to have contributed to the patient's death. The review also determined that insufficient attention to human factors in the electronic health record played a significant role in the error and highlighted an opportunity for future enhancement of the CPOE system to include human factors thinking in the design.

================================================================================

Title: Miscommunication in the OR Leads to Anticoagulation Mishap

The Case:
A 63-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes was scheduled to undergo bilateral femoral artery embolectomy. Eight months previously, he had experienced a myocardial infarction and was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Six days prior to surgery, as instructed by the surgeon, he stopped taking his aspirin and clopidogrel in order to decrease the risk of bleeding during and after the operation.

On the day of surgery, just prior to anesthesia induction, the team conducted a preoperative briefing, using the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist. The patient's identity, the operation, the surgical site, and the anesthesia plan were verified. The surgeon told the anesthesiologist that the patient would benefit from epidural analgesia continued into the perioperative period. However, he failed to mention that postoperatively the patient would be therapeutically anticoagulated with enoxaparin for several days. The anesthesiologist was new to the hospital and unfamiliar with the postoperative management of patients undergoing femoral artery embolectomy. After surgery, no formal postoperative debrief was conducted. Unaware that the patient was going to be placed on enoxaparin, a blood thinning medication, the anesthesiologist continued orders for epidural analgesia and the epidural catheter remained in place.

The patient was started on enoxaparin per the surgeon's order. Five days later, the epidural catheter was removed. Fortunately, the patient did not experience bleeding, a potential and sometimes devastating complication of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with epidural catheters.

================================================================================

Title: Over-the-Counter Oversight

The Case:
A 56-year-old man was evaluated in the burn clinic for a second-degree burn on his chest. Although portions of his skin were healing well, the patient was told that he would require skin grafting to ensure a complete recovery. He was scheduled for a preoperative evaluation prior to the date of surgery. During the preoperative visit, the patient's prescription medications were reviewed and updated in his medical record. During the surgery, the patient experienced profuse bleeding and required transfusion of multiple units of blood products. His blood counts and vital signs were closely monitored after surgery and he eventually stabilized. Postoperatively, the attending surgeon reviewed the patient's medications with him in detail and specifically asked about medications purchased over the counter. The patient reported that he purchased aspirin over the counter and had been taking one pill every day, including on the day of surgery. Although the patient had been asked about blood thinning medications at his preoperative visit, he didn't realize that he should have mentioned taking aspirin because he obtained it without a prescription and he was not specifically asked about over-the-counter medications.

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Diagnosis of Endocrinologic Emergencies

The Case:
Case #1:

A 47-year-old man with a history of hyperthyroidism and hypertension presented to the emergency department (ED) with subjective symptoms of "not feeling himself." He told the ED clinician that he had been unable to take his medications for several months due to financial difficulties. Initial evaluation revealed low-grade fever, a heart rate of 170 beats per minute, and trace lower extremity edema bilaterally. There were possible infiltrates on his chest radiograph. An electrocardiogram revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient was started on a diltiazem drip and admitted to the telemetry unit for management of his heart rhythm and possible pneumonia. He continued to have fevers and tachycardia during the first 2 hospital days despite antibiotics and fluids. On top of that, he developed lethargy and delirium.

A new hospitalist assumed care of the patient on the third hospital day. She reviewed the laboratory results and found that the patient had an undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a high level of circulating thyroid hormone—indicating a diagnosis of thyroid storm (a severely overactive thyroid gland). These laboratory tests had been ordered in the ED. Although results were available the following day, they had not been noted or acted upon. The hospitalist realized that this life-threatening syndrome almost certainly explained the patient's clinical condition. She immediately discontinued intravenous fluids, started treatment with propranolol to control the heart rate and methimazole to suppress thyroid hormone production, and consulted an endocrinologist.

However, the patient remained lethargic and developed hypoxemia over the course of the day. An echocardiogram showed a diminished ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle, consistent with a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle due to longstanding rapid heart rate). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening respiratory status. Shortly after arrival in the ICU, he went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.

Case #2:

A 53-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and mechanical aortic valve replacement was admitted with shortness of breath and lower leg swelling for several days attributed to an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure. On the second hospital day, she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring transfer to the ICU for management. She was started on an amiodarone drip and reverted to normal sinus rhythm within 12 hours. She stabilized and was discharged home on oral amiodarone therapy.

Over the next 3 months, the patient had multiple hospital admissions for presumed COPD exacerbations requiring treatment with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and oral steroids. She also developed abnormal liver function tests and was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. Eventually, she was readmitted to the hospital with hypothermia, hypotension, delirium, and continued hypoxemia. She had bilateral infiltrates on her chest radiograph and was assessed as having septic shock due to pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU and required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Her liver function worsened, and she developed pseudo-obstruction of her colon (Ogilvie syndrome) requiring decompression.

On a Saturday afternoon, well into her prolonged hospital stay, her condition worsened. The covering physician reviewed her old labs and found a very high TSH level and undetectable levels of thyroid hormone. This test had been ordered during a hospitalization one month previously, but the result was not documented in any progress notes, and there was no evidence that anyone had acted on the result. The physician realized that the result likely indicated myxedema coma—systemic illness due to lack of thyroid hormone. Her worsening respiratory status, liver abnormalities, and colonic pseudo-obstruction were all consistent with severe hypothyroidism. This thyroid dysfunction is a known complication of amiodarone therapy, but despite the patient's multiple hospitalizations and overall worsening clinical status, none of her prior physicians had recognized this diagnosis.

The patient was immediately started on levothyroxine and endocrinology was consulted. However, within 24 hours, she went into multi-organ failure and respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as institution of vasopressors due to shock. Although her condition improved slightly, she could not be weaned from the ventilator and developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia. She had previously stated her wishes to avoid resuscitative measures or a prolonged ICU course. After extensive discussions with her family, the goals of care were changed to comfort measures only. She died peacefully in the ICU after a 3-week hospitalization.

================================================================================

Title: Palliative Care: Comfort vs. Harm

The Case:
An 83-year-old man with chronic kidney disease and end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF) with a severely reduced ejection fraction was admitted for an exacerbation of his CHF. It was his third admission in the previous 4 weeks. During this admission, he improved slightly with treatment, but his overall prognosis remained poor. In discussions with the patient and his son, the patient expressed that he would like to focus on comfort and pursue hospice care. His life expectancy was believed to be weeks to months, based on his comorbidities and frailty.

While he was still hospitalized, comfort measures were initiated. His diuretics, statins, beta-blockers, and other treatments for his heart failure were stopped. He seemed more at peace after making the decision and was able to spend time with his family. Wanting to ensure the patient's comfort, the inpatient team wrote for a standing dose of intravenous hydromorphone every 4 hours.

On the night shift, the bedside nurse went to see the patient at 3:00 AM to administer the next scheduled dose of hydromorphone. The patient appeared to be sleeping but woke up when the nurse came in the room. She asked him, "Are you having any trouble breathing?" He responded, "A little bit," but he remained drowsy. The nurse administered the scheduled dose of intravenous hydromorphone.

The following morning, the palliative care attending saw the patient at 7:00 AM and found him obtunded, with shallow respirations and a low respiratory rate. She believed he was close to death and contacted his family, who came to see him. The patient continued to be obtunded and unarousable, but his respiratory rate and effort improved. He survived for another 5 days in the hospital, requiring a few doses of intravenous hydromorphone for comfort. He died peacefully with his family at the bedside.

In reviewing the case, the palliative care team felt that the overnight dose of hydromorphone may not have been indicated and may have been excessively large. Although the patient did not suffer and died peacefully, they believed that his life may have been shortened. At the same time, the review team remained sensitive to the bedside nurse's desire to relieve suffering in a patient who wanted to focus on comfort. They wondered how best to educate providers about the balance between providing adequate pain control at or near the end of life and minimizing harm.

================================================================================

Title: Specimen Almost Lost

The Case:
A 29-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a rash that had spread across her legs and abdomen. She was admitted to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of the painful, itchy rash.

To determine the etiology of the rash, she underwent a punch biopsy of her skin. The resident entered orders into the patient's electronic health record (EHR) indicating that the biopsy specimen should be sent to pathology for further evaluation. The resident also discussed the orders with the patient's nurse. The bedside nurse took the biopsy specimen to the pathology laboratory but neglected to print a copy of the resident's orders to accompany the specimen. The pathology laboratory did not have access to the same EHR as the inpatient medicine service, and the pathologist could not view the resident's orders. Without a printed copy of the orders, the biopsy specimen could not be directed to the appropriate area in the pathology laboratory for processing and analysis.

The following day, the resident attempted to look up the results of the biopsy but found none. The resident called pathology and, luckily, the laboratory had placed the specimen on hold instead of discarding it. The resident was able to print a paper order form and bring it to the laboratory so that the specimen could be processed and read by a pathologist. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein purpura and managed appropriately.

================================================================================

Title: Hyperbilirubinemia Refractory to Phototherapy

The Case:
A 1-day-old full-term infant was noted to have elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) of 14.7 mg/dL (251 μmol/L) due to hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO incompatibility). The patient was placed on a mattress with embedded phototherapy lights in the mother's postpartum room. Despite the treatment, the TSB level continued to climb, reaching 18 mg/dL (308 μmol/L).

The patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and staff began preparations for an exchange transfusion. In the meantime, a neonatologist asked that the irradiance level of the phototherapy lights be tested, and it was found to be well below the recommended level. The lights were replaced. The infant's TSB level began to drop and the exchange transfusion was aborted.

Further investigation revealed that there had been no regular testing of phototherapy light irradiance and that some of the unit's equipment had aging lights with insufficient irradiance levels. A protocol was put in place to ensure: (i) testing of irradiance levels prior to each use of the phototherapy mattresses or other device; (ii) routine monthly irradiance level testing of all phototherapy devices; and that a label is placed on each device with the date and time of the last test.

================================================================================

Title: High-Risk Medications, High-Risk Transfers

The Case:
A 47-year-old woman with history of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was admitted to the hospital for sepsis secondary to an infected intravenous (IV) line through which she was receiving IV treprostinil, a potent pulmonary vasodilator used for. Given its potential toxicity, it is categorized as a "high alert" medication. The patient's home pump was switched to another line that had been inserted in the intensive care unit (ICU). The bedside nurse received education about treprostinil, with special instructions not to flush the line as this would lead to a very large and dangerous dose. The ICU nurses were very familiar with using treprostinil in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

After the patient's infection improved and blood cultures cleared, the decision was made to have the interventional radiologistsplace a new permanent catheter. She was transferred to interventional radiology (IR) with a full treprostinil supply, and the sign-off between the ICU charge nurse and the IR department included instructions to not flush the treprostinil line.

During preparation in the IR suite for the new line placement, one of the infusion pumps started alarming. However, the charge nurse was outside the suite at that time. A radiology technician in the room attempted to identify the alarm, and in the process accidentally flushed the treprostinil line. Consequently, the patient received an excessive amount of the medication, which resulted in a near code situation. The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, which required emergent intubation.

The charge nurse entered the room while the patient was being resuscitated, recognized the error, and stopped the medication. Once the patient was stabilized, a pharmacist was consulted, and the patient was restarted on a lower dose of treprostinil to allow for elimination of the excess medication. She was extubated and eventually discharged home after a prolonged ICU stay.

After this incident, inservice training was given to all individuals involved in the use of this high-alert medication, including medical, pharmacy, and nursing staff. In addition, a new protocol was established that requires the charge nurse to escort patients during all transfers from the ICU.

================================================================================

Title: Translating From Normal to Abnormal

The Case:
A 54-year-old Spanish-speaking woman with depression and anxiety disorder presented to an urgent care clinic complaining of headache and worsening dizziness. She had seen her primary care physician a few weeks earlier for the same symptoms and, after a normal physical examination, she was prescribed meclizine for symptomatic treatment of the dizziness. She now presented with a worsening headache and dizziness. During the interview with the urgent care provider, she was anxious about the nature and degree of her symptoms. The history was obtained using a telephone Spanish medical interpreter from a medical interpreter/translator company contracted by the hospital.

The patient had a normal physical examination, including a normal neurologic exam, during the urgent care visit. However, given the worsening symptoms and persistent headache, the provider ordered an urgent magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain. The MRI was completed later that day and officially interpreted as normal, with no concerning findings and no explanation for her symptoms. Given the patient's anxiety, the urgent care provider wanted to inform her of the results that day. He called the phone number in the record but there was no answer and no opportunity to leave a voicemail. He decided to send a letter to ensure receipt of the results.

However, he was worried that the patient would not be able to read the letter or have anyone to translate it and decided to use Google Translate to do so himself. He typed the following into Google's translator: "The results of your recent MRI were normal, making an infection, mass, or stroke unlikely causes of your symptoms. Please make sure to follow up with your primary care provider and call the clinic with any questions." Unfortunately, the Google-translated output was such that, when the patient received the letter she could not understand the statement. She interpreted the wording to mean that the MRIshoweda mass, infection, or stroke. She became very anxious and immediately returned to urgent care, bringing the letter with her.

Another urgent care provider (also English-speaking) saw her and had difficulty obtaining a clear history from the anxious and tearful patient. Even though the provider read the normal findings of the MRI included in the patient's electronic chart and described this to the patient using a phone interpreter, she remained distressed and upset, complaining of a severe headache and worsening dizziness. He referred the patient to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the ED, neurology was consulted and concluded that the patient's symptoms were likely benign positional vertigo (a common condition that leads to intermittent dizziness) with amplification of her symptoms by her anxiety. She was treated with an Epley maneuver, taught to perform this maneuver at home, and discharged.

The second urgent care provider was troubled by the case. He took the letter to an in-person medical interpreter who read the letter and noted that the language and syntax used by Google Translate was confusing and could indeed have been understood to relay serious findings. The miscommunication led to patient distress, frustration, and unnecessary visits to the urgent care clinic and ED. Both urgent care providers were left wondering whether software programs that translate from one language to another are accurate enough to be used in health care.

================================================================================

Title: The Forgotten Radiographic Read

The Case:
A 60-year-old woman with peripheral artery disease and chronic mesenteric ischemia was admitted for management of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) stenosis. She underwent IMA and right renal artery stenting by vascular surgery and was transferred to an internal medicine teaching service for ongoing management of hyponatremia and hypertension during the second week of hospitalization.

On hospital day 18, the patient had sudden nausea and abdominal distension. The overnight cross-cover intern evaluated the patient and ordered an abdominal radiograph. Although the patient was uncomfortable, her vital signs were stable, and the intern did not observe an acute abdomen on examination. The intern read the radiograph as an ileus and attributed patient's symptoms to this; tube feeds were held. While the intern intended to contact radiology to confirm her interpretation, another patient acutely deteriorated (requiring a Code Blue activation), and she forgot to follow up on the radiograph. Early the next morning, the vascular surgery patient developed delirium, hypotension, and hypoxemia, and she was emergently transferred to the intensive care unit.

The radiograph was formally read by a radiology attending at approximately 8:00 AM. She immediately recognized portal venous gas—a sign of acute mesenteric ischemia. She contacted the primary team, who ordered a CT angiogram, which revealed internal mesenteric artery dissection, diffuse bowel ischemia, and infarction of the liver and spleen. After discussion between surgery, the primary team, and the family, the decision was made not to pursue further surgery as the expected mortality was extremely high. The patient was transitioned to comfort care and died that evening.

The case was formally reviewed by the medical service and by radiology. The reviews concluded that the delay in diagnosis of internal mesenteric artery dissection and bowel infarction represented a preventable adverse event. The major contributing factors were considered to be the workload of the overnight cross-cover intern and the lack of a formal system for obtaining radiology interpretations of radiographs performed overnight. At this hospital, the overnight staffing on the medicine service consisted of two hospitalists, two senior residents, and one intern, but the intern was "first call" for all acute issues overnight. The radiology department had two residents in house overnight, but provided interpretation only for emergency department studies, CT scans, and MRIs performed overnight. Regular radiographs were not formally read until the morning, unless specifically requested.

================================================================================

Title: Failed Interpretation of Screening Tool: Delayed Treatment

The Case:
An 88-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of upper back pain. His medical history was significant for hypertension and longstanding mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. His initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/75 mm hg, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, temperature of 36.3°C, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Physical examination revealed a frail elderly man in no distress. He had normal heart sounds and a soft systolic murmur heard best at the apex; his lungs showed faint bilateral crackles. He had no spinal tenderness and a normal neurological examination, including mental status. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory investigation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count, serum lactate, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function. A chest radiograph showed hilar fullness and mild bilateral infiltrates, consistent with pulmonary edema or early pneumonia.

The emergency physician assessed the patient as having either new onset congestive heart failure or an atypical pneumonia. She considered starting antibiotics but held off as the patient looked well and did not "screen positive" for sepsis. (The hospital had recently implemented a formal sepsis screening system for all ED patients.) The patient was admitted for workup of his hypoxemia. The admitting internist also deferred starting antibiotics, in part guided by the negative sepsis screening. He ordered an echocardiogram for the next morning and prescribed diuretic medications. At the time of ward admission (4 hours after presentation), the patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Early the next morning, the patient acutely decompensated with worsened hypoxemia, hypotension, and delirium. He remained afebrile, but repeat labs now showed a markedly elevated serum lactate level and white blood cell count. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated worsened bilateral infiltrates. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the intensive care unit. However, he rapidly experienced further respiratory decompensation requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as hemodynamic compromise requiring vasopressor support. Later that day, his blood and sputum cultures grew Escherichia coli. Over the next 4 days, he developed progressive organ dysfunction and died.

Title: Point-of-care Mixup: 1 Shot Turns Into 3

The Case:
A 2-month-old boy was brought in for a routine 2-month well-child visit. The exam was completed and the appropriate vaccinations were ordered, including Pentacel (which contains vaccines against DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis], Hib [Haemophilis influenza], IPV [inactivated polio vaccine]), Hep B (hepatitis B), PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), and RV (rotavirus). The nurse gave the vaccinations to the infant, and then, when documenting them in the electronic health record, noticed she had given the DTaP vaccination, not the Pentacel combination. The patient and his mother were still in the exam room; the mother was breastfeeding the infant.

The physician spoke with the mother about the error. The mother was distressed to learn that her son would need two additional injections but agreed for them to be given because she knew her child needed the additional vaccinations (Hib and IPV). The patient cried and was difficult to settle after the additional injections. In the postincident review, the nurse described being rushed and because of that, she did not properly verify the vaccinations against the orders before administering them.

Title: Add-on Case and the Missing Checklist

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain and weight loss. Based on diagnostic data and imaging, she was found to have a large gastric mass concerning for malignancy. The patient had recently been diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis, which was being treated with enoxaparin (an anticoagulant). A gastroenterologist was consulted for possible biopsy of the gastric mass. The gastroenterologist planned to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy the following day. This recommendation was not conveyed directly to the hospitalist caring for the patient, although the consultant did document it in his note.

The next day, the patient was scheduled for an EGD as an add-on case. Because the hospitalist was unaware of the plan, the patient was not made NPO (nothing by mouth), nor was the enoxaparin stopped. When the endoscopy suite called for the patient, the bedside nurse said that the patient had just had breakfast, but she forgot to mention that morning dose of the anticoagulant had already been given. Three hours later, the patient was taken to the EGD suite. While performing the preanesthesia checklist, the certified nurse anesthetist documented that enoxaparin had been given that morning, but did not notify the gastroenterologist. EGD was performed and a biopsy was taken from the mass. The patient was observed briefly in the recovery room and sent back to her room on the ward.

Two hours later, the patient developed delirium and looked pale. She was found to be hypotensive and stat labs were sent. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids was started, but within 15 minutes, the patient went into cardiac arrest. The laboratory results showed a sharp drop in her blood count, consistent with postprocedural bleeding. The patient was resuscitated, transferred to the intensive care unit, and received massive transfusions. An angiogram revealed that the bleeding was from the gastric mass. Embolization was attempted but was unsuccessful, and the patient subsequently arrested again. After extensive discussions with the family, the decision was made to focus on comfort measures only. The patient died shortly thereafter.

Title: Despite Clues, Failed to Rescue

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with a history of systolic heart failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease who was healthy and active at baseline was admitted for an elective dilatation and curettage for postmenopausal bleeding. Because she had relatively low blood pressures during the operation and slightly more bleeding than expected, she was admitted to the inpatient gynecology service for monitoring. A postoperative hemoglobin check showed a drop from 9.5 g/dL before the procedure to 6.8 g/dL. She was given a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells but not evaluated by a provider.

The following morning, she complained of severe abdominal pain with nausea, which the gynecology team attributed to postoperative pain. When she had persistent severe pain later that day, her heart rate was 145 beats per minute (bpm), and she had new-onset atrial fibrillation. She was moved to a telemetry unit and cardiology was consulted. The consulting cardiology service ordered medications to control her heart rate and initiated rivaroxaban, a systemic anticoagulant, for her atrial fibrillation.

The next morning, her hemoglobin level was 7.5 g/dL and her creatinine had increased from a baseline of 2.1 mg/dL to 3.1 mg/dL. Throughout the day, her severe abdominal pain and nausea continued. At 7:00 PM, she had an episode of hematemesis (bloody vomit). Her vital signs were normal, and she was given intravenous fluids. No laboratory values were checked, and there were no urgent interventions. Despite the hematemesis, the rivaroxaban was continued.

Later that night at 2:00 AM, she had another episode of hematemesis. The gynecology resident evaluated the patient and found her to be confused and complaining of abdominal pain. Stat labs were ordered but not reviewed until the following morning. She was given intravenous fluids overnight but received no specific treatments. Laboratory results were reviewed at 6:00 AM and showed her hemoglobin had dropped to 5.8 g/dL, and her creatinine had risen to 4.5 mg/dL. Bedside evaluation revealed she was hypotensive (blood pressure 75/45 mm Hg), tachycardic (heart rate 130 bpm), and confused.

The intensive care unit (ICU) team consulted at the bedside and made plans to transfer her to the ICU. While being transferred, she had a pulseless electrical activity arrest in the setting of massive hematemesis, and she died despite maximal efforts. In the end, providers believed she likely developed mesenteric ischemia in the setting of atrial fibrillation and died from bowel ischemia and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The institution performed a multidisciplinary root cause analysis and found many specific errors that contributed to her death. The group acknowledged this case was a clear example of failure to rescue a healthy woman who underwent a simple procedure. They discussed steps to prevent such an event in the future.

Title: The Hidden Harms of Hand Sanitizer

The Case:
A 57-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and severe depression was admitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. After 2 days on the medical ward, she was found unconscious. Oxygen was administered, and the patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator. As part of the workup for her altered mental status, a toxicology panel was drawn, and her blood alcohol level returned elevated at 530 mg/dL. A search of the ward revealed several empty containers of alcoholic foam hand sanitizer. The patient required mechanical ventilatory support for over 12 hours, after which she was successfully extubated. Upon interview, the patient confessed to ingesting the alcoholic foam hand sanitizer on the ward to satisfy her strong alcohol craving.

Title: Delayed Recognition of a Positive Blood Culture

The Case:
A 58-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer recently treated with immunosuppressive therapy presented to the hospital for evaluation of diarrhea. As part of the infectious workup performed in the emergency department (ED), blood cultures and stool studies were sent to the laboratory. The following morning, her stool test returned positive forClostridium difficile(C. difficile), a potent bacteria that can cause serious infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts. At that time, one out of the two blood cultures drawn in the ED was positive for gram-positive rods, but the speciation (type of bacteria) and sensitivity profile (which suggests which antibiotics are best to use) were not yet available. The medical team ordered appropriate antibiotic treatment forC. difficilebut did not initiate treatment for the preliminarily positive blood culture.

After improvement in her symptoms, the patient was discharged 2 days after admission with instructions to complete the course of antibiotics forC. difficileand to follow up with her outpatient providers. On the day of discharge, the blood culture that was positive for gram-positive rods had now speciated and was growingListeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause life-threatening infection if not treated appropriately. Moreover, a diagnosis ofListeria monocytogenesmust be reported to the local department of public health because of its risk of contagion. Unaware that the patient required treatment for listeriosis, the team discharged her.

A later review revealed that the hospital microbiology laboratory was aware of the microbiology result and, per its protocol, had notified the patient's bedside nurse of the positive blood culture. However, this result was not communicated to the primary medical team prior to the patient's discharge. Some team members who saw the positive result in the medical record erroneously thought thatListeria monocytogenesmight be a contaminant (a bacteria that can be viewed as a false positive not requiring treatment). Although the positive blood culture was sent to the medical attending's inbox in the electronic health record, he did not see the result until well after the patient was discharged. When the mistake was recognized, the team called the patient and she was immediately readmitted to the medical service. The positive blood culture was reported to the city's department of public health. She received further workup including additional blood cultures and a lumbar puncture, which remained negative. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated for treatment of listeriosis. She was eventually discharged and did well.

Title: Diagnostic Overshadowing Dangers

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with history of opioid abuse was sent to the emergency department (ED) from a methadone clinic because she appeared confused when she came to get her daily dose of methadone. In the ED, the patient complained of pain in her epigastric region and back. She was given IV fluids for tachycardia (heart rate 140 beats per minute [bpm]) and hypotension, with prompt improvement in her blood pressure but not in tachycardia. The initial electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 156 bpm and initial laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 19,000/μL, troponins at 0.38 μg/L, and creatine kinase of 270 U/L. A CT scan of her abdomen revealed multiple fractures at thoracic and lumbar spinal region with possible cord compression.

Neurosurgery was consulted and the attending requested an MRI to further evaluate the spinal cord. The patient was given pain medication but remained tachycardic. The MRI, performed about 13 hours after admission, revealed an acute L2 fracture with cord compression. Neurosurgery recommended conservative management until morning. The patient was admitted to the ward, still tachycardic and complaining of pain in the epigastric region. The medical team attributed her pain to the fracture.

The next morning, the patient's troponin levels were in the 20s μg/L and creatine kinase was approximately 900 U/L. However, because of a delay in reporting, by the time the medical team saw the laboratory test results, it was 28 hours into the admission. A stat electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation in the inferior leads, diagnostic of a myocardial infarction. A "Code STEMI" (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) was called, but the clinicians chose to delay taking the patient to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, since they wanted the use of any antiplatelet agents to be cleared by neurosurgery in light of her spinal fracture. A bedside echocardiogram revealed severely reduced left ventricular function with an akinetic inferior wall and an ejection fraction of about 10%.

The patient was eventually stabilized on cardiac medications. At the time of discharge, it was unclear how much of her cardiac function might recover. As the team reflected on the case, they believed that they had not responded aggressively enough to the patient's epigastric pain because of her history of drug use and chronic pain.

================================================================================

Title: Chest Tube Complications

The Case:
A 30-year-old woman with a history of cystic fibrosis was admitted to the hospital for management of a spontaneous left pneumothorax (collapse of her lung). She required urgent thoracostomy (chest tube) placement in the emergency department. The chest tube was connected to wall suction in order to promote reexpansion of her lung.

Over the next 2 days, the patient improved, and repeat imaging showed reexpansion of her lung. The consulting pulmonary team felt that the chest tube might be able to be removed, so they requested that the tube be disconnected from suction and clamped. The plan was to obtain a chest radiograph 1 hour after clamping the tube, and if the pneumothorax had not recurred, the tube would be removed.

About 45 minutes after the tube was clamped, the patient complained of acute, sharp pain radiating to her left arm. The nurse gave the patient pain medication. She noted that the radiograph had not yet been done but assumed that it would be done soon. Unfortunately, the radiograph was not done, and the nurse became busy with another acutely deteriorating patient.

Approximately 2 hours later (3 hours after the tube was clamped), the nurse found the patient unresponsive, in cardiac arrest with a rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. A code blue was called. The code team recognized that the arrest could have been due to a tension pneumothorax, reconnected the chest tube to suction, and eventually performed needle decompression. Despite these measures, the patient did not recover spontaneous circulation for more than 30 minutes and sustained severe anoxic brain injury as a result. The patient required tracheostomy and feeding tube placement, and she was eventually transferred to a long-term care facility with a poor neurologic prognosis.

The hospital conducted a root cause analysis (RCA). The RCA committee found that there was considerable variation around chest tube removal practices between services. For example, the trauma surgery service did not routinely perform a clamping trial before chest tube removal. Although other services did perform such a trial, there was variation in when the radiograph was performed after clamping the tube. The committee noted that this variation led to confusion among bedside nurses about how to monitor patients and communicate with physicians immediately after chest tube removal. As a result, the committee felt the complication might still have occurred even if the radiograph had been performed.

Case:
A 70-year-old man with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (status post kidney transplant), coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease requiring lower extremity bypass surgery in the past, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock secondary to an infected lower extremity wound. Soon after admission, he developed hypotension refractory to intravenous fluid resuscitation. The ICU team decided that the patient required central venous catheter placement in order to administer vasopressors to improve his blood pressure.

The ICU at this hospital was a closed system, where the ICU team had primary responsibility for daily management and acute issues, including performing procedures. The surgical team rounded on patients daily and discussed the plan of care with the ICU team regularly, but the team was not first call and did not write routine orders. The ICU team thus decided to place the central line after confirming the plan with the surgical team. Establishing central venous access in this patient was challenging. He had been on hemodialysis in the past through a right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, which had failed. Due to worsening function of his transplanted kidney and anticipated need for restarting hemodialysis, he had a catheter in his left internal jugular vein already. The combination of this catheter and his prior fistula meant that upper extremity catheter placement was not possible. The ICU team therefore chose to place the central line in the right femoral vein and was able to do so after much effort. However, the team failed to recognize that the patient's transplanted kidney was also on the right side. This was a serious mistake, as femoral catheter placement is contraindicated on the same side as a transplanted kidney due to the risk of damaging the vein to which the transplanted kidney is anastomosed (surgically attached).

As the ICU team was finishing the procedure, the transplant surgeon arrived and recognized the mistake. The surgeon was furious at the ICU team for making such an error. Attempts were made to cannulate the left femoral vein, but they were unsuccessful due to the presence of blood clots. The patient required vasopressor administration through the right femoral line for several hours despite the risks, as he remained hemodynamically unstable. Eventually, the left internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a different catheter that could be used for vasopressor administration.

Over the next few days, the patient's kidney function continued to worsen and hemodialysis was initiated. The relationship between the ICU team and the surgical team remained tense and mistrustful, and the intensivists eventually ceded primary responsibility for the patient to the surgeons. The patient's overall condition did not respond to aggressive therapy for septic shock, and he eventually developed multiple organ system failure. After extensive discussion, his family eventually decided to pursue comfort measures only, and he died on hospital day 12.

Title: Hemolysis Holdup

The Case:
A 72-year-old man with congestive heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department (ED) with new onset generalized weakness. The ED physician ordered a chemistry panel, which came back as showing evidence of acute kidney injury, as well as a serum potassium level of 7.4 mEq/L (normal range 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L). However, the laboratory noted that the patient's blood sample was hemolyzed, which can spuriously increase the measured serum potassium.

The ED physician assumed that the first result must have been incorrect due to hemolysis, but felt that the patient should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment of his acute kidney injury. She ordered a repeat potassium level and called the hospitalist for admission. The hospitalist noted mild electrocardiographic abnormalities that could have been consistent with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), but she did not institute immediate treatment for hyperkalemia as the repeat level was still pending. The patient was admitted to the medical ward.

When the patient arrived at the floor, he started to feel more confused and lethargic and he became progressively more hypotensive and bradycardic. The laboratory then called the hospitalist with a panic result—the repeat potassium level had come back at 8.4 mEq/L, a level associated with a high risk of cardiac complications. Almost immediately thereafter, the patient went into cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and emergently administered calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin to treat the hyperkalemia. He was able to be resuscitated and was emergently transferred to the intensive care unit for initiation of hemodialysis. The patient had a lengthy hospital course, but he ultimately survived and was discharged home off dialysis and with improved renal function.

Title: Wrong-side Bedside Paravertebral Block: Preventing the Preventable

The Case:
An 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department following a mechanical fall at home. The fall occurred as she attempted to sit down in the bathroom and missed the toilet, falling backwards and striking her right back and flank against the bathtub. Imaging demonstrated multiple right-sided rib fractures.

The patient was admitted to the medical-surgical ward. On the first hospital day, the patient continued to have difficulty with maximal inspiration because of pain associated with the rib fractures. The clinical team decided to obtain an anesthesia consultation to place a paravertebral block. The anesthesiologist performed the block on the patient while she was in her bed. At the completion of the block, postprocedure imaging was performed to rule out complications. It was then that the performing physician realized that the fractures were on the opposite side—which meant that the block had been placed on the wrong side. This was then confirmed by reviewing the chart.

On review of the case, it was noted that the personnel carrying out the procedure at the bedside had not performed the usual safety checks or a "time out" to identify the correct side.

The patient required an additional paravertebral block on the correct (right) side to control the pain, increasing her chances of postprocedure complications, including bleeding and pneumothorax. Because of the error, the patient was exposed to unnecessary additional medication, and the institution bore unnecessary additional costs for the additional local anesthesia, regional block instrument tray, and personnel (the patient was not charged for the repeat procedure).

Title: Patient Allergies and Electronic Health Records

The Case:
A 40-year-old woman presented with recurring intense right upper quadrant pain, which worsened with large meals. Her past medical history was significant for cholecystectomy 3 years earlier and gastroesophageal reflux disease controlled by proton-pump inhibitors. After she was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, an abdominal CT scan with contrast was ordered.

Upon the patient's arrival at the CT scan, a technician reviewed the electronic health record (EHR) for allergies and found none documented. The technician asked the patient whether she had ever responded poorly to contrast media or dyes. In response, the patient stated she had experienced hives upon receiving contrast in the past. Consequently, the patient was premedicated prior to receipt of the contrast agent, and diagnostic imaging was completed without further incident.

During a follow-up clinic visit, the patient discussed this contrast intolerance with a medical assistant, assuming the allergy had been documented in her medical record. Surprisingly, the intolerance was not listed. A follow-up investigation revealed that the previously stated intolerance had been removed from the patient's allergy profile and never updated at the clinic appointment. The investigation found that the medical assistant had removed contrast from the patient's allergy list because it was not a "true" allergy. She intended to ask where to document an intolerance in the EHR but forgot to ask. Consequently, the EHR had no evidence of either allergy or intolerance to contrast. This case led to a system-wide analysis of practices regarding allergy documentation in the EHR and development of a mechanism to prevent a similar event in the future.

Title: Engaging Seriously Ill Older Patients in Advance Care Planning

The Case:
A 94-year-old woman with history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and gout presented for a routine primary care visit to a new physician, an intern in the local training program. She had been seen in the housestaff clinic for more than 10 years by a series of residents, each handing over her care to a new intern at the end of their residency. Her previous resident had recently graduated.

The intern reviewed the patient's chart and discovered that the patient lived alone, walked mainly with a cane, and was able to manage all of her activities of daily living independently. She did have severe hearing impairment and could not read or write (she never learned literacy skills). Notably, in the last year the patient had been hospitalized 5 times for CHF exacerbations or pneumonia. She had experienced a clear functional decline in the previous 3 months.

In reviewing the medical record, the intern discovered the patient's code status in the hospital and in the clinic had always been documented as "full code." The intern was surprised to see that there was no documentation of any in-depth discussions of the patient's wishes. Given the patient's comorbidities and recent decline, the intern was quite concerned that she was at very high risk for becoming seriously ill and requiring aggressive life-sustaining measures.

During their first visit, the intern asked, "Has anyone ever talked with you about what you would want if you got so sick that you needed artificial life support to survive?" The patient answered, "You know, no one has ever asked me about that. I guess I always figured the doctors would just do what is right."

The intern performed a more detailed chart review and spoke with the patient's daughter. He discovered no evidence that any health care provider had ever engaged in advance care planning with the patient.

Concerned about the possible harm the patient could experience, the intern and his supervisor engaged the patient in a thoughtful discussion of her wishes. Ultimately she stated clearly she would not want full resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, or any other aggressive artificial life-prolonging measures. She told them with a smile and a wink, "Hey, when it's my time, I'm fired up and ready to go!"

================================================================================

Title: Correct Treatment Plan for Incorrect Diagnosis: A Pharmacist Intervention

The Case:
A 48-year-old woman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection, migraines, polysubstance abuse, and a penicillin allergy presented to the emergency department with complaints of headache and blurry vision. Meningitis was ruled out by a negative lumbar puncture; neurosyphilis was ruled out by a negative cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Additional blood tests were sent out to test for other infectious causes of her symptoms, and the patient was discharged home. Following her discharge, the results of a full infectious disease panel returned showing a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin but positive FTA-ABS, a potential indication of latent syphilis. The patient was asked to return to the infectious disease clinic for follow-up.

At the follow-up appointment, the infectious disease attending recommended standard treatment: penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses. Because of her allergy history, the patient was first sent to the hospital for penicillin sensitivity testing. The plan was to initiate the penicillin desensitization protocol if she had an allergic reaction to initial testing, or to give her the first dose of penicillin and have her report to the Department of Public Health for the remaining doses if she did not.

The penicillin sensitivity test result was negative, so the allergist placed orders to initiate penicillin therapy. Recalling the patient's previous symptoms of headache and blurry vision, the allergist placed orders for neurosyphilis treatment (a far higher penicillin dose, and an inappropriate one since neurosyphilis had been ruled out). These orders included hospital admission, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placement, and penicillin G 4 million units every 4 hours via the PICC line.

On seeing the admission diagnosis of neurosyphilis, the pharmacist verifying the patient's admission orders performed a thorough chart review. The pharmacist realized that neurosyphilis had been ruled out and contacted the allergist to clarify the treatment plan. The allergist recognized the error, and the orders were corrected to reflect treatment for latent syphilis. The patient received her first IM dose of penicillin G benzathine and was referred to receive her two additional doses of penicillin. The pharmacist's catch prevented an unnecessary hospital admission, a PICC line, and multiple doses of IV penicillin.

================================================================================

Title: Diagnosing a Missed Diagnosis

The Case:
A 57-year old woman was admitted to the hospital with cough, slurred speech, confusion, and disorientation. She was taking modified-release lithium for bipolar disorder. Her medical history was also significant for primary hyperparathyroidism and coronary artery disease. A brain CT on admission showed no evidence of a stroke or intracranial bleed. Her initial serum sodium level was normal at 140 mmol/L, but her serum calcium level was mildly elevated. Her initial serum lithium level was also mildly elevated at 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's delirium was attributed to hypercalcemia, so she was admitted to the ward and hydrated with intravenous (IV) normal saline. Her lithium was continued. The following day, she remained confused and disoriented. Her hypercalcemia had slightly improved, but her serum sodium had risen to 149 mmol/L. The bedside nurse told the physician that the patient seemed to be going to the bathroom frequently; urine output had not been formally recorded. The physician attributed the rising sodium to the IV fluids and decided to continue aggressive hydration given the lack of improvement in her symptoms. A repeat lithium level was not ordered.

That evening, the nurse found the patient to be comatose and minimally responsive. The patient was urgently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where repeat labs showed a sodium level of 163 mmol/L (normal < 145 mmol/L). She required intubation for airway protection, and a repeat lithium level was markedly elevated at 2.1 mmol/L. After admission to the ICU, her urine output was noted to be 500 cc/hour of extremely dilute urine, consistent with a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to lithium toxicity.

The patient was successfully managed in the ICU with 5% dextrose infusion to gradually correct her hypernatremia. Her lithium was held, and she was treated with ibuprofen and diuretics. Her mental status gradually improved and she was able to be extubated on hospital day 3. Fortunately, she did not experience any neurologic sequelae, and she was discharged home on hospital day 7. Her lithium was discontinued and she was started on valproic acid for treatment of her bipolar disorder.

================================================================================

Title: Consequences of Medical Overuse

The Case:
A 76-year-old woman with history of hypertension, diabetes, and advanced dementia was brought to the emergency department (ED) from a nursing facility with confusion and generalized weakness. Based on her initial evaluation, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and started on antibiotics in the ED. As part of this evaluation, she was found to have a mildly elevated troponin I level (0.10 μg/mL; normal is < 0.07 μg/mL). Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was unchanged from her baseline and showed no evidence of ischemia. She did not complain of chest pain or shortness of breath.

The hospitalist admitting the patient consulted a cardiologist for evaluation of the elevated troponin levels. The cardiologist recommended starting aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin for treatment of possible non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The hospitalist wondered if this was overly aggressive treatment for the elevated troponin but followed the specialist's recommendations.

The following day, the patient remained confused. Her troponin level rose to 0.13 μg/mL and was 0.12 μg/mL on repeat. Her ECG continued to show no evidence of myocardial ischemia. At the recommendation of the cardiologist, the aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin were all continued.

That evening, the patient became acutely confused. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift. She was placed on a mechanical ventilator and transferred to the intensive care unit. Given the bleeding, the heparin, aspirin, and clopidogrel were discontinued. Unfortunately, despite aggressive treatment, she developed evidence of cerebral herniation and became comatose. After discussions with the family, the patient was transitioned to comfort measures and she died a few hours later.

The root cause analysis of this adverse event determined that treatment with three anticoagulants was not clinically indicated as the patient did not have objective evidence of an NSTEMI. The committee believed the overly aggressive treatment had led to the patient's death.

================================================================================

Title: Refused Medication Error

The Case:
A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure and mental status changes. He was alert to self and place only. The patient had end-stage liver disease and was not following his home treatment regimen. Specifically, he was noted to have doubled his daily dose of furosemide for more than 5 days in an attempt to remove edema. He was also noted to be poorly adherent with his lactulose.

Initial therapy was to carefully correct his acute renal injury while using lactulose to improve his hepatic encephalopathy. With treatment, both his mental status and his creatinine improved. Throughout his admission, he was assessed as a very high fall risk on a standard risk scale. As his platelet level was less than 40,000 ?l, the staff's level of concern was heightened, in that a fall could be associated with dangerous bleeding.

As his hospitalization progressed, the patient refused to take his lactulose because of frustration with frequent, loose stools. The nursing staff noted the patient refusal in his medication record, but did not inform his primary care team. On the fourth day after his initial refusal, the patient became more confused, now only oriented to self, and began acting impulsively, including getting out of bed without assistance. The nurse alerted the primary care team of the patient's declining mental status and their concern about increased fall risk, but did not describe the missed doses of lactulose. The patient was placed on close observation for safety purposes but continued to decline and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

After being transferred to the ICU, the patient's mental status further deteriorated, and he became comatose and required intubation. The following morning, his next-of-kin and health care surrogate provided documentation of the patient's wish to forego mechanical ventilation. Less than 24 hours after admission to the ICU, the patient was extubated and died shortly thereafter.

================================================================================

Title: Safeguarding Diagnostic Testing at the Point of Care

The Case:
A 23-year-old woman presented to the family medicine clinic for contraception. She was sexually active with one partner and expressed interest in long-term contraception. After talking with her provider, she selected intrauterine device (IUD) placement.

The protocol in the clinic was to check a urine pregnancy test prior to placing an IUD. The patient provided a urine sample to the nurse. Point-of-care testing in the office revealed a negative result. The physician informed the patient and then placed the IUD during the same visit without complication.

At the end of her shift, the nurse manually entered the results of all point-of-care tests performed in the office that day into the appropriate patient's electronic medical record. By mistake, she entered the result of the urine pregnancy test for this patient as positive instead of negative. When the patient's provider received the positive result via electronic notification, she recognized the error and immediately corrected the medical record.

Although the mistake was recognized quickly and no incorrect information was relayed to the patient, the provider decided to review the results of all point-of-care tests that had been manually entered into the electronic health record system for her patients that day to make sure there were no other errors.

================================================================================

Title: The Hazards of Distraction: Ticking All the EHR Boxes

The Case:
A 55-year-old woman with a history of metastatic cancer of unknown origin was sent to the emergency department (ED) after a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain (done for cancer staging) showed a right subdural hematoma with a very small (5 mm) midline shift. The patient was alert and oriented when she arrived in the ED, but she did report falling and hitting her head a few weeks before. Her vital signs were normal and she had a normal neurologic examination. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan showed the subdural hematoma was unchanged when compared to the MRI. She was examined by a neurosurgeon in the ED who recommended no acute intervention and repeat imaging in one week. She was admitted to a hospitalist service for observation.

She did well with no new complaints or complications and was discharged from the hospital the following afternoon (about 36 hours after admission). She left the hospital and went directly to a previously scheduled positron emission tomography CT scan, also being done for her cancer workup. On that study, the radiologist noted that the subdural hematoma had enlarged and the midline shift had increased to 11 mm. The patient was readmitted to the same hospital medicine team that had cared for her before. She was stable on admission with no neurologic complaints and a normal neurologic exam.

Unfortunately, the next day, her mental status deteriorated and a repeat CT scan showed an enlarging subdural hematoma. She was taken to the operating room for evacuation of the blood. The surgery was uncomplicated, but postoperatively she developed sepsis secondary to a hospital-acquired pneumonia. Despite maximal efforts, the sepsis progressed to multi-organ system failure. Care was ultimately withdrawn and she died peacefully 10 days after admission.

The hospital medicine service routinely reviewed all deaths on their service. In reviewing the death, the case review committee discovered the patient had been given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis during the first admission. They spoke with the admitting provider for that admission. She did not realize she had prescribed the LMWH and stated she certainly didn't intend to prescribe it in light of the subdural hematoma. She stated that she was just "clicking boxes" on the admission order set in the electronic health record (EHR), and that she was used to ordering it as nearly all patients she admitted met criteria for VTE prophylaxis. She did recall being distracted by another complex patient at the time of entering the admission orders.

The case review determined that ordering the LMWH was a medical error that may have contributed to the patient's death. They realized there clearly were many benefits to using order sets in the EHR, but wondered about the risks associated with order sets and how best to balance the risks and benefits.

================================================================================

Title: A Potent Medication Administered in a Not So Viable Route

The Case:
A 55-year-old man with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe systolic dysfunction, as well as diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease, was brought to the emergency department for septic shock of possible intra-abdominal origin. Owing to his cardiac condition, he was given a minimal fluid challenge and vasopressor support was ordered.

The plan was to start norepinephrine bitartrate after the placement of a central intravenous line. However, for reasons that are unclear, the norepinephrine was infused through a peripheral line. It was started at a low dose but then titrated up to 20 μg/hr to address the patient's continued hypotension. Approximately 7 hours later, when the intensive care unit team arrived to transfer the patient to the critical care unit, they were surprised to not find any central line. Instead, they found the norepinephrine was infusing in the peripheral line placed near the patient's right wrist.

The patient now complained of severe pain. However, given his altered mental status in the setting of sepsis, he could not point out where he felt the pain. His right arm, and particularly the fingers, had a bluish discoloration. The team recognized that the vasopressor had extravasated into the subcutaneous tissue of the arm. A right internal jugular line was immediately placed, and the norepinephrine switched to infuse through this central line. Attempts were made to treat the extravasation and salvage the right wrist and fingers, but eventually three of the patient's fingertips had to be amputated. The patient eventually recovered from his sepsis and was discharged home.

The case was discussed in the multi-departmental morbidity and mortality review, and a new protocol was issued that potent medications may be started only after the pharmacy, primary medical team, and nurses identify the medication, route of administration, and plan for titration. The protocol also stated that vasopressors may only be infused through central lines.

================================================================================

Title: The Missing Abscess: Radiology Reads in the Digital Era

The Case:
A 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes and hypertension who had three previous cesarean deliveries presented with menorrhagia and anemia from large fibroids. She underwent a hysterectomy to remove the fibroids. To preserve hormonal function, the ovaries were not removed. The surgery was uncomplicated.

Postoperatively, she developed a fever and pelvic pain, and a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large pelvic abscess. She was given antibiotics, and a percutaneous drain was placed. Over the next few days, her fever resolved and her pain improved. The infection was felt to be adequately treated, the drain was removed, and she was discharged.

The patient re-presented to the hospital 3 days later with recurrent abdominal pain. A repeat CT scan was performed and the radiologist reported a persistent large pelvic abscess. The gynecologist examined the patient and read the radiologist's report but did not personally review the CT scan images herself. Based on the report, she took the patient to the operating room for treatment of a presumed recurrent pelvic abscess.

In the operating room, the gynecologist had difficulty finding the abscess. She stopped the surgery and looked at the CT scan images on a computer in the operating room. She realized that what the radiologist had read as an abscess was actually one of the patient's ovaries, and that there was no evidence of a recurrent abscess or other infection. The surgery was aborted and the patient was taken to the recovery room. The initial complaint of abdominal pain on this admission was felt to be related to the incision and not to any infection.

Unfortunately, the patient developed a wound infection related to this second surgery. The infection led to delayed wound healing and a prolonged hospital stay. She went on to develop chronic abdominal pain, some of which was thought to stem from the unnecessary exploratory surgery.

================================================================================

Title: Hazards of Loading Doses

The Case:
A 40-year-old woman was recently discharged after a prolonged hospitalization for seizures and a cardiac arrest. Two days after discharge, she presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Her stool tested positive forClostridium difficilecolitis, which led to admission to the medicine service. As part of the initial ED patient evaluation, the neurology fellow (seeing the patient because of her history of seizures) noted a subtherapeutic phenytoin serum level and subsequently recommended that she be re-loaded with phenytoin. The ED physician ordered the correct loading dose of intravenous (IV) phenytoin, to be administered every 8 hours for 3 doses. Unfortunately, the physician failed to order that the dose be switched back to the appropriate maintenance dose of once daily after the loading was completed, so the patient continued to receive IV phenytoin every 8 hours.

Three days after admission, the patient developed somnolence, severe ataxia, and dysarthria. These new symptoms prompted the medicine provider to evaluate the patient's hospital course and medication history. After noticing the phenytoin dosing at every 8 hours, he checked a serum phenytoin level, which returned at 3 times greater than the maximum therapeutic level. The patient's neurologic symptoms persisted for 3 days after discontinuation of phenytoin. However, no long-term harm occurred.

Investigation of the event revealed that the admitting medicine physician did notice the unusually high phenytoin dose; however, he did not question it because he assumed it was recommended by the neurology service. Apparently, the neurology consultant told the ED physician about his recommendations, but no formal consult note had been placed in the patient's chart to provide clear instructions for phenytoin dosing or monitoring.

================================================================================

Title: The Empty Bag

The Case:
A 90-year-old woman with end-stage dementia was admitted to an acute care hospital for treatment of a hip fracture after a fall at a nursing home. During the hospitalization, her kidney function worsened, as did her mental status. Because of this, the patient's family chose not to put her through surgery, and she was placed on the hospice service for comfort care.

The care team identified that the patient had increasing restlessness and that the current order for intravenous (IV) push morphine PRN [when necessary] was not effective for pain control. The physician ordered a morphine drip for better pain control. The nurse set up the morphine drip along with a carrier solution of normal saline. He placed the normal saline on a pump but failed to place the morphine drip on a pump as well. He mistakenly set the rate intended for the morphine on the pump that the normal saline was on, and opened the clamps for both solutions. He turned the pump on and left the room to answer an alarm for another patient. The nurse had five other patients assigned to him that day.

The nurse checked on the patient approximately every 30 minutes, but only observed from the doorway and asked the family members present how things were going. Approximately 4 hours after the nurse started the morphine drip, he noticed that the patient was breathing very slowly and went to the bedside to examine her. He noted that the patient appeared near death and explained this to the family. Realizing that the morphine bag was empty, he immediately called the physician, obtained an order for naloxone, and administered it to the patient. However, the patient died shortly thereafter.

Later, the bedside nurse and the charge nurse went back into the room to examine the IV set-up and pump. They discovered that the morphine was connected into the tubing below the pump for the saline (instead of in its own pump), which meant it had flowed into the patient at an uncontrolled rate.

================================================================================

Title: One Dose, Two Errors

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis and respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was intubated and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while waiting for blood culture results. A few hours into the admission, the microbiology lab called the ICU to report that the blood cultures were growing yeast. The report was received by the nurse and relayed to the covering resident. The patient was immediately started on treatment with intravenous (IV) amphotericin (an antifungal drug), and broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued.

Two days later, the patient's respiratory status was improving and she was extubated. However, she was noted to have worsening renal function and decreased urine output, and she needed to be placed on hemodialysis on hospital day 3. The consulting nephrologist felt that amphotericin toxicity was the most likely cause of the acute kidney injury. A new resident took over the patient's care that day, after the previous resident rotated off service. She reviewed the laboratory data and was surprised to find that the patient had no positive blood cultures reported in the electronic medical record. She called the microbiology lab, who confirmed that the patient had not had any positive blood cultures. In the course of the discussion, she came to a troubling realization: the positive yeast cultures were actually for the patient in theadjacentICU bed.

Further review revealed that the information about the positive yeast culture had been correctly called in to the bedside nurse, who then relayed to the correct resident. However, the resident had been caring for both patients, and he mistakenly entered the amphotericin order for the wrong patient.

At this hospital, prescribing IV amphotericin required approval from an infectious disease specialist due to its potential for toxicity. The resident who placed the order had, in fact, called the infectious disease fellow, described the correct patient, and obtained approval for the medication. However, once the verbal approval was secured, no further verification was required—the resident merely had to enter "infectious disease approval obtained" into the free-text section of the electronic order for amphotericin.

Once the error was detected, the amphotericin was immediately stopped. The patient who had received the drug continued to require hemodialysis for several more days. Although she was not dialysis-dependent when discharged from the hospital, her kidney function never returned to her previous baseline. The other patient—who should have been started on amphotericin—did not experience any adverse consequences as a result of the delay in initiating appropriate therapy.

================================================================================

Title: Suicidal Ideation in the Family Medicine Clinic

The Case:
A 20-year-old woman with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and a history of multiple inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations for prior suicide attempts called her primary care doctor's office at 10:30 AM stating that she had been "cutting her wrists" and had taken "extra doses of medication."

A front office staff member who did not have any clinical training answered the patient's phone call. He informed the patient that the next available appointment was at 3:00 PM that afternoon. The primary care doctor was not notified of the patient's behavior at the time of the phone call.

During the patient's office visit that afternoon, she was noted to have multiple cuts on both her wrists and stated that she "did not care" if she harmed herself. She stated that in addition to cutting herself, she had ingested several lithium pills. Recognizing that the patient was at high risk for suicide based on her behavior and medical history, the evaluating physician called security to escort the patient to the emergency department for a formal psychiatric assessment and inpatient admission. However, the patient was unintentionally left unattended for a brief period and eloped before providers could evaluate her.

The emergency department physician notified the local police who found the patient at her apartment later that evening. Luckily, she had not engaged in additional self-destructive behavior. She was brought back to the emergency department and ultimately admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit for further treatment.

================================================================================

Title: Continuity Errors in Resident Clinic

The Case:
A 32-year-old woman presented to internal medicine clinic for evaluation of headaches and difficulty concentrating. The symptoms began after a motor vehicle collision a week earlier. She tried to schedule the visit with her primary care doctor—a resident—but his available slots were already full. This was not unusual—his availability was often limited to one clinic session per week due to his inpatient clinical obligations. Therefore, the appointment was booked with another resident provider.

During the clinic visit, the patient relayed the events of the collision to the resident. She reported that she had been sitting in the backseat, wearing her seatbelt, and that the impact caused her to strike her head on the window. Immediately after, she had been taken to a local emergency department for evaluation. Physical examination and head imaging were unremarkable, and the patient was discharged home. She subsequently developed headaches and difficulty concentrating as well as sensitivity to sound and light. The resident diagnosed probable postconcussive syndrome and started the patient on amitriptyline.

Given a lack of improvement in her symptoms, the patient returned to the same clinic 4 days later. Again, her primary provider was not available to see her. The resident who had seen her initially was no longer on his outpatient rotation, and the appointment was booked with a different resident provider. This resident ordered a brain MRI and placed a referral for the patient to be seen in neurology clinic. The resident had never placed a subspecialty referral before and did not realize that there were multiple neurology clinics. When the patient arrived at the neurology appointment several days later, she was informed that the referral had been made to the neuromuscular clinic though it should have been made to the headache clinic.

The patient returned to the internal medicine clinic for a third time because she was still experiencing severe headaches. This time she was able to see her assigned primary care provider. Although she was frustrated by the lack of continuity and incorrect neurology referral, the patient repeated in detail the same history she had relayed to the first and second resident providers. Her primary provider increased the dose of her amitriptyline and placed a new neurology referral to the headache clinic. The patient's headaches improved, and she was feeling much better by the time she saw the neurologist.

================================================================================

Title: Don't Dismiss the Dangerous: Obstetric Hemorrhage

The Case:
A 19-year-old woman, pregnant at 35 weeks gestation, was admitted to the labor and delivery unit in the setting of new hypertension. Blood tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL and mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 205 mg/dL and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 189 mg/dL).

Given concerns for preeclampsia and for viability of the fetus, she was taken to the operating room for an emergency cesarean delivery. The delivery was uncomplicated with an expected degree of bleeding; the infant was delivered in good condition. The mother was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. A postoperative hemoglobin level was 9.6 g/dL.

Over the next few hours, the patient had progressive tachycardia and persistent hypertension. Out of concern for pulmonary embolism, a computed tomography scan was ordered, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. She continued to have worsening tachycardia (heart rate in the 140s) and some new abdominal discomfort.

Repeat blood tests were done 8 hours after the previous ones and showed a hemoglobin level of 3.6 g/dL. Her AST was 1185 mg/dL and her ALT 1344 mg/dL. She was given blood transfusions and taken back to the operating room out of concern for postpartum hemorrhage. In the operating room, approximately 3 liters of blood were evacuated from the uterus. A source of bleeding could not be found so the uterus was packed with gauze, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit in critical condition.

Over the next few hours, the patient had progressive shock, respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She required vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and more than 10 units of packed red blood cells. She had a long and complicated hospital course but was ultimately discharged to a rehabilitation facility with no major permanent injuries.

================================================================================

Title: Unexpected Drawbacks of Electronic Order Sets

The Case:
A 70-year-old man with stage 4 prostate cancer presented to the emergency department with severe muscle weakness. His lab results revealed severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia (2.2 mmol/L and 1.2 mEq/L, respectively). His electrocardiogram was significant for QTc prolongation and U-waves. The admitting team noted the patient had recently been started on abiraterone, an antiandrogen drug known to cause hypokalemia.

Because the patient had symptomatic hypokalemia, the medical resident was instructed to order potassium replacement using the hospital order set. Using the patient's potassium value to select the appropriate hypokalemia order set, the resident signed the order in the new electronic health record. However, while receiving his IV potassium repletion, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia and became nonresponsive. No resuscitation efforts were made due to the patient's DNR status.

Hypomagnesemia often accompanies hypokalemia. Despite the patient's low serum magnesium levels, neither the resident nor medical team recognized that the patient required magnesium replacement along with the potassium. Before the hospital transitioned to computerized provider order entry (CPOE), orders for common electrolytes were available on a single paper order set with check-boxes to indicate the appropriate replacement dose and route for specific lab values, including potassium and magnesium.

When the hospital recently switched from paper orders to CPOE, all order sets were imported into the electronic health record. However, to minimize the amount of information presented on each screen, a separate order set was created for each electrolyte replacement order (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). The team responsible for transitioning the paper orders to CPOE did not realize that the old paper electrolyte order set provided a reminder to order magnesium replacement to accompany potassium replacement, and that, by separating out the order sets electronically, an important safety reminder was lost. An internal investigation concluded that the transition to electronic order sets contributed to mismanagement of the patient's low magnesium and potassium levels, which resulted in a fatal arrhythmia.

================================================================================

Title: Near Miss With Neonate

The Case:
A 37-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the hospital for scheduled induction of labor for postterm dates. Early the next morning, intravenous oxytocin was administered to induce labor.

When the obstetrics team rounded on the patient several hours later, AROM (artificial rupture of membranes) was recommended to accelerate labor. The intern reviewed the patient's chart and noted that a culture done from a vaginal and rectal swab at 36 weeks was negative for group B streptococcus (GBS)—a bacteria that sometimes colonizes the gastrointestinal and genital tracts of pregnant women. If documented at any time during pregnancy, the infant is at increased risk of infection at the time of delivery. The intern failed to note that faxed records from a clinic outside the hospital system included another culture—a urine culture positive for GBS. This test had been ordered at an office visit earlier in the patient's pregnancy. Given this positive culture, to prevent transmission of GBS infection to the infant, the patient should have been started on intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis before the membranes were ruptured.

The senior resident on the team happened to review the faxed records and noted the positive urine culture. She immediately ordered antibiotics and delayed AROM for several hours to allow time for the medication to infuse. Luckily, the senior resident's "catch" made this case a near miss, and the patient ultimately delivered a healthy infant and experienced no adverse consequences.

================================================================================

Title: Lapse in Antibiotics Leads to Sepsis

The Case:
A 34-year-old near-term pregnant woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain, fevers, and shortness of breath. Upon further evaluation, she was noted to have a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure. Laboratory studies, including blood cultures, were drawn. Given that the fetus was in distress, intravenous (IV) antibiotics were administered and the patient was rushed to the operating room for an emergent cesarean delivery. The amniotic fluid was foul smelling and chorioamnionitis—an infection of the amniotic sac that can cause severe infection in both the mother and the baby—was diagnosed.

After delivery, the patient was transferred to the hospital floor and admitted to the postpartum service. Antibiotics should have been continued to treat the infection, but the initial order was placed as a one-time dose by the ED providers, and the inpatient team did not realize that it had been discontinued. Several hours later, the patient was noted to be lethargic with a low blood pressure. IV fluids were administered. While the inpatient care team discussed possible causes for her low blood pressure, the microbiology lab called to notify the team that the patient's blood cultures had grown gram-negative rod bacteria. At that point, the team realized that the patient was in septic shock. A review of the inpatient orders revealed that IV antibiotics had not been continued since the initial dose administered almost 24 hours earlier in the ED.

Although antibiotics were administered immediately, the patient's clinical status deteriorated further, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit for management of septic shock. She required intubation and hemodynamic support but eventually made a full recovery. The delay in appropriate treatment of sepsis with continued antibiotic therapy on admission resulted in a longer and more complex hospital stay for the patient.

Title: Unintended Consequences of CPOE

The Case:
A 60-year-old woman with a history of metastatic colon cancer and known malignant ascites was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She presented with sepsis and acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (up from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL). She underwent paracentesis and was found to have evidence of acute bacterial peritonitis. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The cultures from her peritoneal fluid grew multiple bacterial species, raising concerns for bowel perforation. Her creatinine improved but remained elevated at 1.6 mg/dL and the team felt the persistent acute kidney injury was probably from her sepsis. The team decided to order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast. After a discussion, they decided to order the scan without intravenous contrast, out of concern for causing worsening renal function (i.e., contrast nephropathy).

The intern caring for the patient was rotating at this hospital for the first time and was new to the computer system; in fact, she had not ordered a CT scan through the system yet. She only vaguely remembered the necessary steps from the online computer module she had completed 5 weeks earlier as part of her orientation to the training program.

When entering the order for the CT scan, there was a long list of options that were labeled in many different ways. She scanned the list and chose the one named "CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast," assuming that she'd need to order the oral contrast separately. She placed the CT scan order, along with a separate order for the oral contrast.

Unfortunately, the CT scan that she ordered had, bundled with it, the use of oral contrast and intravenous contrast. The patient therefore received both kinds of contrast during the scan. The next day when they reviewed the images and saw evidence of both kinds of contrast, the team recognized the error. The patient's creatinine worsened over the next few days, rising to a peak of 3.1 mg/dL. The team caring for the patient felt this was consistent with contrast nephropathy.

The patient remained in a hospital for 6 more days for monitoring and adjustment of her other medications. She ultimately was discharged to an inpatient hospice facility.

================================================================================

Title: Wrong-Time Error With High-Alert Medication

The Case:
A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for a total knee arthroplasty. During the admission process in the early evening, the surgical resident restarted his maintenance home medications, including oral dofetilide (an antiarrhythmic agent) taken every 12 hours. In the electronic health record, drugs ordered for "q12 hour" dosing are scheduled for 6 AM and 6 PM by default. The overnight nurse saw that the morning dose was scheduled to be given at 6 AM, but the patient was scheduled to leave for the operating room before 6 AM, so she gave the dose early, at 4 AM. During his preoperative assessment at around 6 AM, the patient was noted to have severe QTc prolongation on his electrocardiogram, putting him at high risk for torsades de pointes, a sometimes fatal arrhythmia. Considering the acute ECG changes (prior QTc intervals were normal), surgery was canceled and the electrophysiology service was consulted.

The electrophysiology fellow felt that the 4 AM dofetilide administration likely contributed to the arrhythmia. Dofetilide is known to be associated with QTc prolongation if administered too early or at excessive doses. Further investigation revealed the patient also took his previous night's dose later than usual, at 10 PM. Consequently, rather than having received his dofetilide doses 12 hours apart, the 2 doses had been given only 6 hours apart. Neither the surgical resident nor the nurse responsible for administering the drug was aware of the risks associated with deviation from the strict 12-hour dosing interval, and neither had asked the patient about the timing of his last dofetilide dose.

The patient was monitored on telemetry for a few days, and surgery was delayed until the return of his QTc to baseline. After this case, the hospital added dofetilide to a list of drugs that could only be ordered by a specialty service.

================================================================================

Title: Complaints as Safety Surveillance

The Case:
A 42-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She said the pain came on suddenly that morning after binge-drinking vodka. The pain was in the epigastrium, radiated around to her back, and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Her laboratory studies showed elevated amylase and lipase, and a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. She was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous fluids and intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain control.

The next morning, the patient was still experiencing moderately severe abdominal pain. She requested "more of the medicine that starts with a 'D.'" The hospitalist—not being entirely familiar with the pain medication she was on—said that he would increase it. He decided to increase her 1 mg dose of Dilaudid to 4 mg and asked the nurse to administer another dose immediately. The nurse thought it unusual to increase the pain medication so much, but she remembered that this hospitalist had a reputation for being brusque and defensive when his orders were questioned. She administered the medication without challenging the order.

About 10 minutes later, the nurse returned to check on the patient and found her to be unresponsive and apneic. She immediately called the hospital's rapid response team, who administered naloxone (a medication that reverses the effects of opioid medications). Despite this treatment, the patient remained unresponsive and had to be transferred to the intensive care unit. She was intubated for airway protection and treated with a naloxone infusion overnight until her mental status and respiratory status improved. She was successfully extubated the next day. Her hydromorphone was discontinued and the patient was treated with oral pain medications for the remainder of her hospital stay. Following improvement in her pancreatitis, she was discharged home in stable condition.

Due to the severity of the event, the hospital's patient safety committee investigated the incident with a formal root cause analysis. The hospitalist was interviewed and admitted that he was unfamiliar with prescribing hydromorphone. He had assumed it was similar in potency to morphine, but in fact, 1 mg of intravenous hydromorphone is equivalent to 4 mg of morphine. The hospital's patient relations committee reviewed its records and found that in the past 2 years, 3 other patients had filed complaints about the care provided by the hospitalist. None of those patients had clearly experienced an adverse event, but the hospital faced a decision about how best to address the concerns about the quality of the physician's care.

================================================================================

Title: A Pill Organizing Plight

The Case:
As part of an outpatient geriatrics rotation, an internal medicine resident visited one of his patients—an 80-year-old, Spanish-speaking woman with multiple medical problems including hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux, coronary artery disease, and depression—in her home for recent onset of lightheadedness and dizziness. At a recent outpatient visit, she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer dementia for which she was prescribed a new medication, donepezil. Her family was advised that she would require ongoing assistance to manage complex tasks including organizing her medications.

During the home visit, the resident reviewed the patient's medications in detail. The patient's medical record revealed that she was supposed to be taking eight medications daily, including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, pantoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux, aspirin for coronary artery disease, simvastatin for hyperlipidemia, escitalopram for depression, and the newly prescribed donepezil.

The patient reported using a pillbox, which her daughter sometimes filled for her when she visited. The resident identified several errors in the pill organization system, including empty slots for upcoming days as well as slots that contained a higher number of blood pressure medications than the patient was supposed to take. The resident also discovered that an old blood pressure medication (a beta-blocker), which had been stopped by the patient's cardiologist months ago, was still in the pillbox. As a result of these problems, on some days the patient was taking up to five blood pressure pills when she was only supposed to be taking two. The resident suspected that her symptoms of lightheadedness and dizziness were the result of intermittently overdosing on blood pressure medications. Additionally, the resident discovered that the new medication—donepezil—was not in any of the pill slots because the patient's daughter was unaware that it had been prescribed to the patient and therefore never picked it up from the pharmacy.

Fortunately, the resident was able to spend time explaining the clinical significance of each medication to the patient's daughter and helped her develop a standard approach to filling her mother's pillbox each month. A follow-up home visit revealed that once the pillbox had been properly organized, the patient's lightheadedness and dizziness had resolved.

================================================================================

Title: Falling Between the Cracks in the Software

The Case:
A 61-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis was scheduled for a total knee replacement. Prior to surgery, he saw his orthopedic surgeon in clinic because of increased pain. The surgeon prescribed oxycodone. The new prescription was reflected in the outpatient medical record, which was on a different information technology platform than the hospital system and did not communicate with it. At the time of hospital admission, the patient did not remember to mention the oxycodone as a new medication when asked for his list of outpatient medications.

Unaware that the patient had started taking oxycodone, the anesthesiologist, hoping to achieve adequate postoperative pain control, placed an epidural catheter through which morphine was administered. While in the postanesthesia care unit, the patient became somnolent from receiving morphine on top of the oxycodone he had already taken earlier that day. Despite the administration of naloxone, the patient required intubation and a brief intensive care unit stay. He was quickly extubated and experienced no long lasting adverse effects from the medications.

If the inpatient medical record had been automatically updated to include the patient's oxycodone, the anesthesiologist would have taken this into account when administering morphine. The lack of interoperability between the office-based medical record platform and the inpatient system contributed to the error.

================================================================================

Title: Getting the (Right) Doctor, Right Away

The Case:
A 57-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent hip surgery. Postoperatively, the patient was short of breath and remained in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring of her respiratory and cardiac status while awaiting an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. When the patient suddenly lost a pulse, providers initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which led to a return of spontaneous circulation.

As part of the evaluation for the patient's shortness of breath, providers ordered a chest radiograph, which showed a pneumothorax. But the radiologist, who knew that such a finding might require emergent treatment (usually a chest tube), found herself unable to find the correct ("first call") physician to page regarding this critical information. She was forced to call the PACU, find a nurse, and then have the nurse access the online physician scheduling system to determine who was currently the first call physician.

When the results were eventually communicated to the first call provider, needle thoracostomy was performed immediately and a chest tube was placed. The patient's shortness of breath resolved, and she was moved to the ICU after being stabilized. A follow-up chest radiograph showed resolution of the pneumothorax. Thus, while the delay in reaching the first call provider did not lead to long-term harm to the patient, it easily could have.

================================================================================

Title: Communication With Consultants

The Case:
A 30-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, headaches, and fevers. Her laboratory studies were notable for a markedly elevated white blood cell count of 121,000 (normal is 5,000–10,000, and routine infections virtually never raise the count above 25,000, making this level highly suspicious for a hematologic malignancy). The ED physician contacted the hematologist on call regarding the abnormal complete blood count (CBC). The hematologist informed him that she would follow up the labs and see the patient the following day.

Later that afternoon, the patient was admitted to the hospital by the primary medical team and continued to worsen through the night. She became progressively tachypneic with an increasing oxygen requirement, ultimately requiring intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. The primary team did not attempt to contact the hematologist again overnight, assuming that the information about the patient's tenuous clinical status and markedly elevated white blood cell count had been adequately conveyed by the ED provider and that no acute intervention was required overnight, which is why the hematologist had decided to see the patient the following day. In fact, the hematologist had been told only that the patient had an "abnormal CBC with a pending differential" and that her input might be helpful. She was unaware of the urgent nature of the consult.

The following day, the hematologist confirmed the diagnosis of leukostasis as the result of acute myeloid leukemia—an oncologic emergency for which treatment should have been initiated immediately. Although leukapheresis and induction chemotherapy were ordered, the patient had already developed multi-organ system failure as a result of the delay. She was transitioned to comfort measures and died shortly thereafter.

================================================================================

Title: July Syndrome

The Case:
A 64-year-old man was seen in the thoracic surgery clinic in June after being diagnosed with a right lower lobe lung cancer. The attending surgeon saw the patient along with his fellow, who was completing his 1-year fellowship. By that point in the year, the attending had supervised the fellow's operative and postoperative care of nearly 100 patients, and he trusted him completely. The patient was a good candidate for surgery, so the surgeon discussed the operative plan (a right lower lobe lobectomy) briefly with the fellow and had the procedure scheduled for a few weeks later.

The procedure was scheduled for the first week of July. However, by this time, the fellow who had seen the patient in clinic had graduated and left the institution. The procedure itself was uneventful and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively. The initial postoperative orders were written by the new thoracic surgery fellow, who had just started his fellowship and was new to the organization. He wrote brief orders for postoperative care, assuming (as had been the case at the hospital where he did his residency) that the ICU team would write more comprehensive orders.

The patient was received in the ICU by a surgical intern, who was in her first rotation and had also graduated from medical school elsewhere. The patient's nurse noticed that there were no orders for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, despite the patient being at high risk for VTE. She brought this to the intern's attention. The intern assumed that VTE prophylaxis was contraindicated, since the fellow had not ordered VTE prophylaxis; she also recalled an incident during medical school where a surgery intern had been chastised for starting VTE prophylaxis inappropriately. Although the standard postoperative order set in the electronic medical record included a prompt for a VTE prophylaxis order, the intern found that she could easily skip this order and complete the rest of the order set without difficulty. Therefore, the patient was not prescribed VTE prophylaxis.

Two days later, the pharmacist on the ICU team was reviewing orders for the patient and realized that the patient was not receiving VTE prophylaxis. She brought this to the attention of the intern, who replied that she thought it was contraindicated so she had not ordered it. The pharmacist conferred with the ICU attending, who agreed that VTE prophylaxis should have been started postoperatively and made sure it was started that day. Fortunately, the patient experienced no adverse consequences as a result, but the pharmacist and ICU attending wondered what could have been done to limit the risk of such an event in the future.

================================================================================

Title: The Case of Mistaken Intubation

The Case:
A 65-year-old man with a history of end stage renal disease, injection drug use, and multiple prior infections was living at a skilled nursing facility (SNF). He had recently been discharged from the hospital after a prolonged and complicated hospitalization for severe sepsis secondary to osteomyelitis.

During a routine morning vital signs check at the SNF, he was found confused and tachypneic, complaining of severe shortness of breath. Paramedics were immediately called, and they found him hypoxic, hypotensive, and tachycardic. He was taken to the hospital. A packet with the appropriate documentation from the nursing facility was transported with the patient. The physician at the SNF who knew him well called the emergency department (ED) to provide clinical details.

When the patient arrived in the ED, he had persistent hypoxia despite maximal oxygenation. The ED providers attempted to determine the patient's wishes for intubation and life-sustaining care, but no family members were present and they could not find clear documentation in the records from the SNF.

The patient was intubated and placed on a mechanical ventilator, and a central line was inserted. He was treated for severe pneumonia with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. The ED providers contacted the inpatient internal medicine team for admission.

The inpatient team happened to be the same team that had recently discharged him. When hearing about the case, the resident asked why the patient had been intubated as the patient had made it clear during the last admission that "he did not want to be intubated or resuscitated under any circumstances." The resident stated the patient had completed a POLST form (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Therapy), and the team had clearly documented his wishes in the discharge summary. They had also spoken directly with the provider at the SNF.

The admitting team evaluated the patient in the ED. When the patient's family arrived, the team explained to them that the patient had been intubated because his wishes were not clear when he arrived to the ED in acute respiratory distress. In discussions with the family, all agreed the patient would not want ongoing aggressive therapy. The endotracheal tube was removed and he was taken off life support. He died peacefully later that day with his family at the bedside.

Given the serious nature of the adverse event, the case was referred for a formal root cause analysis (RCA). At the RCA, a number of errors were identified, including:

================================================================================

Title: The Fluidity of Diagnostic "Wet Reads"

The Case:
A 64-year-old man with heavy tobacco use presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. His electrocardiogram showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia, but his blood pressure was markedly elevated. The treating physician, concerned about a possible aortic dissection, ordered a CT angiogram of the chest. The preliminary ("wet") read from the radiologist was communicated to the ED physician—it reported "no evidence of aortic dissection," so the patient was discharged home once his symptoms resolved. He was advised to establish care with a primary care physician (PCP). A final read of the CT scan would be performed the following morning, but by then the patient was already home and no clinician reviewed it that day.

The patient saw his new PCP about 1 month later and reported fatigue, a chronic nonproductive cough, and a 17-pound weight loss over the past year. He brought his printed after-visit summary (AVS) from the ED visit, which noted that a chest CT had been performed, which showed no aortic dissection. After reviewing the AVS, the PCP assumed there were no other concerning findings on the CT scan. As it was a very busy clinic day, he did not review the final radiology report for the CT scan. The PCP counseled the patient on tobacco cessation and obtained basic lab tests to work up his fatigue and weight loss. He scheduled the patient for a follow-up visit in 1 month.

The patient missed this follow-up appointment and ultimately returned to the clinic several months later. At that point, he told the PCP that his cough had worsened and was now producing blood-tinged sputum. Concerned, the PCP immediately obtained a chest radiograph, which showed a large right upper lobe nodule. Only then did the PCP review the formal report from the earlier CT—which had documented "a suspicious noncalcified, spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung measuring approximately 1.2 cm in diameter, concerning for malignancy given the patient's history of tobacco use"—and realize that the nodule had been seen previously. It was not clear if any physician had been informed about the lung nodule after the final reading of the earlier CT was issued. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma involving the right upper lung.

The error was disclosed to the patient with the help of clinic leadership and risk management. The patient was understandably upset that he was not made aware of the initial findings, but he continued working with providers to expedite his care.

================================================================================

Title: Mismanagement of Delirium

The Case:
An 85-year-old man with early stage vascular dementia fell on the sidewalk and fractured his leg. Although fitted with a cast at a regional hospital, the patient was not able to walk independently. He was given crutches and instructions for no weight-bearing on the injured leg. He was admitted to a skilled nursing facility for physical therapy to establish mobility and for assistance with bathing and dressing. His wife stayed with him most of the day during first 2 days.

Prior to this event, the patient lived at home and was independent in activities of daily living. He used distance and reading glasses, eye drops 3 times daily, and had hearing aids. Over the previous year, he experienced nondisturbing visual hallucinations (e.g., bird in the tree, squirrel on the lawn, bug on the floor). He had disturbed nighttime sleep and occasionally got up at night, showered, and dressed, before asking his wife the time. He experienced frequent daytime sleepiness with varying levels of concentration. He had a shuffling and sometimes propulsive gait, and he fell easily.

On day 3 in the skilled nursing facility, prior to arrival of his wife, the patient became delirious and agitated. He waved his crutch to keep staff at a distance, threatened to kill them if they approached, and knocked over furniture. The sheriff was called. The patient was taken to the hospital emergency department (ED). The patient spent his first night in the ED hallway with his wife and daughter alternately by his side. On day 2 of hospitalization, he was transferred to a hospital room and was visited by a psychiatrist. That night, the patient became delirious and threw a cup of water at a sitter. On day 3, the patient was lucid and explained he thought he been captured and was trying to escape. He expressed remorse. The psychiatrist recommended transfer to the geriatric-psychiatry ward for better patient management, and the patient's wife accepted the recommendation without understanding the implications. At the time of the transfer, the patient had been immobile for 3 days, and he had constipation, mild dehydration, and pain.

Over the next 2 days, the wife and daughter became concerned about their loved one's care and requested alternate ward placement that allowed a 24-hour family caregiver at the bedside. They further requested that the staff address the patient's mobility needs and work to eliminate some of the delirium triggers. The psychiatric intern was called and explained to the patient's family that the patient has been involuntarily committed, and no change in placement or treatment would be considered. The intern further explained that the primary medical concern was the patient's behavior, not his mobility. The family requested to see the intern's supervisor, who spoke to the family by telephone and confirmed the intern's statement. The family then called the patient's primary care physician, who deferred to the specialists on the overall plan, but requested that the patient's daughter be allowed to stay with the patient overnight. The ward nurse refused the request and the wife and daughter were escorted from the locked ward at 9:30 PM.

The patient continued to experience nighttime agitation and was aggressive toward staff during nights 3–5, which led to the use of restraints. Ward staff extended the daytime visiting hours for the family, 8 AM–10 PM, but continued to refuse the family's requests to stay at night to provide comfort and reassurance. Medical students rounded on days 5 and 6 and administered mini-mental status exams, but no in-depth medical history or dementia evaluation was administered. The patient continued to have constipation, mild dehydration, increased leg pain, and ingrown toenail pain. Risperidone was administered to control agitation and hallucinations on day 5. On day 6, the patient became aphasic, exhibited slurred speech, moaned with discomfort, occasionally cried "spinning," and exhibited breakdown on the skin of his heels and buttocks. On day 8, the patient's wife called the hospital legal department to file a complaint. At that point, the hospital allowed the patient's daughter to spend the night. The patient continued to act out dreams, but having a family caregiver at the bedside prevented escalation to aggression.

The patient was released back to the skilled nursing facility on day 9, with a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. The risperidone was discontinued several months later by a new geriatrician in the skilled nursing facility. Since the precipitating incident, the patient has lost 40 lbs. He now has limited speech, limited mobility, and tardive dyskinesia, and he is dependent for all activities of daily living.

================================================================================

Title: Falling Through the Crack (in the Bedrails)

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman with cirrhosis presented to the hospital with septic shock and respiratory failure. She was placed on a mechanical ventilator and admitted to the intensive care unit. In order to administer medications, a nasogastric tube was also inserted. Although given medications for sedation, the patient was disoriented, and restraints were placed on her wrists to prevent her from pulling out key lines or tubes. She was found to have ascites on examination, and the team decided to perform paracentesis to rule out infection. The intern and resident on the team worked together to prepare the patient for the procedure. The bedrail on one side was lowered, and the wrist restraint on that side was removed to facilitate the procedure.

The procedure went smoothly without any complications. The intern and resident cleaned up the materials from the procedure and left the room. Moments later, multiple alarms went off in the patient's room. As nurses ran into the room, they found the patient confused and trying to get out of bed. She had pulled out the nasogastric tube and the endotracheal (breathing) tube, and her leg was stuck between the bedrail and the bed. She had a large laceration on her foot. Her oxygen saturation fell rapidly, and she required urgent re-intubation. Fortunately, she was safely placed back on the mechanical ventilator. The nasogastric tube was also replaced, and the laceration of her foot was sutured. She slowly improved with antibiotics and supportive care and was ultimately discharged to a nursing facility 10 days later.

In a review of the incident, it became evident that, after the procedure, the wrist restraint was not replaced and the bedrail had been left down. In addition, the team had not communicated with the bedside nurse about when they would be performing the procedure or when they had finished. The institution wondered what steps could be taken to prevent a similar incident in the future, as well as what were best practices for preventing inpatient falls.

================================================================================

Title: Situational Awareness and Patient Safety

The Case:
A 40-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and known esophageal varices was admitted to the hospital with one day of bloody stools. Blood transfusion and IV proton pump inhibitor therapy were initiated. Gastroenterology was consulted to assess and treat the source of her GI bleeding.

On the same evening, a 50-year-old man with a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, complicated by recurrent blood clots and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, was admitted to the next room with a new pulmonary embolus. Given his known adverse reaction to heparin, IV argatroban was ordered for anticoagulation.

The following morning, while pre-rounding on the woman with the GI bleed, an astute intern noticed that one of the medications hanging from her IV pole was labeled as argatroban—but the name on the label matched that of the patient with the pulmonary embolus. The intern immediately notified the nurse that argatroban had been administered to the wrong patient and disclosed this error to the patient. The argatroban infusion was stopped. Fortunately, the patient did not experience any adverse effects.

================================================================================

Title: Lost in Sign Out and Documentation

The Case:
A 71-year-old man presented to the emergency department with chest pain. While being evaluated by the emergency physician, he suddenly went into cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated and underwent emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed multivessel coronary artery disease requiring placement of three stents. The patient was subsequently transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis. He had a prolonged CCU course and eventually needed tracheostomy placement due to inability to wean from the ventilator.

On hospital day 18, he underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. The following day, an abdominal radiograph was performed to check tube placement prior to initiating feedings. The radiograph showed "free air under the diaphragm." The patient had no abdominal symptoms, and the CCU team discussed the case with a gastroenterologist who said that this finding was normal after PEG placement. The primary resident got a "curbside consult" from the on-call surgery resident who also felt that, given the absence of symptoms, the patient could simply be monitored. No official surgery consult was placed in the chart. Tube feeds were started later that day.

The patient was transferred to the ward on hospital day 20. Late that evening, the patient complained of left-sided abdominal pain. Labs showed a marked increase in his white blood cell count. A stat abdominal radiograph revealed a significant amount of air under the diaphragm. Only at that point did the ward team realize that the radiograph done 2 days earlier had also showed the same finding; this issue was not signed out to them when the patient was transferred out of the CCU. The surgery team was urgently re-consulted, and the patient was taken to the operating room. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a large gastric perforation at the PEG tube site and spillage of tube feeds into the peritoneum, with signs of acute peritonitis. Repair of the perforation was performed along with washout of the abdomen. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit from the operating room in septic shock. Fortunately, he eventually recovered and was transferred to a long-term acute care facility on hospital day 30.

The case was reviewed in a multidisciplinary morbidity and mortality conference. Multiple errors were noted, including poor communication between teams and a lack of a standardized signout process for patients being transferred from the CCU to the ward. As a result of this case, a structured signout was designed and implemented with the expectation that both residents and attending physicians on the critical care team would directly sign out patients to the ward team.

================================================================================

Title: Good Night's Sleep Gone Wrong

The Case:
A 64-year-old woman came to the emergency department complaining of cough and shortness of breath, along with an itchy throat and a runny nose. She had a past medical history of end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis 3 times/week), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a left below-knee amputation. Her serum creatinine was 9.48 mg/dL. She was transferred to the hemodialysis unit where she underwent hemodialysis and was then admitted to the medical floor.

That night, the patient was given her home medications at the prescribed doses: zolpidem 10 mg at 22:03 and hydroxyzine 25 mg by mouth at 00:48. At 03:00, the nurse noted that the patient was agitated, crying out, "I will not cooperate until I get some rest." At 11:20, the nurse noted acute changes in mental and neurological status, including severe drowsiness, unresponsiveness to painful deep stimuli, and unequal pupil size. A "Code Stroke" was called. Laboratory results were suggestive of respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for close observation and hemodialysis. All CNS depressants were discontinued. A CT scan showed no evidence of a new stroke. Two days later, the patient was alert, awake, fully oriented, and hemodynamically stable.

Case review revealed that prior to admission, the patient's nephrologist had added a prescription for hydroxyzine 25 mg by mouth at bedtime as needed, because the patient had been complaining of itchiness and continuously picked at her skin. The zolpidem dose had also been increased from 5 mg to 10 mg at bedtime as needed. Then, at the time of admission, she received additional doses of both medications. Although duplicate therapy alerts for zolpidem and hydroxyzine appeared on the order entry screen, it was a "soft stop" without management recommendations, and the ordering physician bypassed the alerts.

================================================================================

Title: Picking Up the Cause of the Stroke

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes was transferred to a tertiary care center from a community hospital for management of persistent abdominal pain and inability to tolerate oral feedings, possibly secondary to diabetic gastroparesis. The day before transfer, the patient had undergone placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) to address his continued need for intravenous pain medications, intravenous fluids, and parenteral nutrition. An initial chest radiograph performed to evaluate the catheter reported the PICC was located in "a persistent left-sided superior vena cava." The physicians caring for the patient assumed the PICC was safe to use, and the patient began receiving nutrition and hydration through the line. He was not receiving any oral nutrition at this point.

The following day, the patient complained of headache, unilateral visual loss, and left-sided tingling and numbness. A stat noncontrast CT scan of the head revealed strokes distributed in an embolic fashion. The radiologist reviewed the chest radiograph and pointed out that the persistent left-sided superior vena cava is in fact a congenital remnant that can drain into the left atrium of the heart. A subsequent CT of the chest revealed the PICC tip was actually in the left atrium, and was therefore delivering fluid into the patient's systemic circulation. Fat emboli from the lipid emulsion infused through the PICC were the likely cause of the patient's strokes.

The patient was urgently transferred to the neurological intensive care unit. He ultimately developed increased intracranial pressure and required intubation, mechanical ventilation, and mannitol to prevent further neurologic damage. The patient was eventually stabilized and weaned off the ventilator, but his neurological deficits persisted. He required a permanent feeding tube and tracheostomy tube, remained unable to perform any activities of daily living independently, and required 24-hour care.

Title: Robotic Surgery: Risks vs. Rewards

The Case:
A 66-year-old man was seen by a urologist for difficulty urinating and diagnosed by biopsy with localized prostate cancer. The urologist recommended a radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate). The urologist stated that the best and safest way to remove the prostate was with a minimally invasive robotic surgery. The robotic surgery, he explained, would involve a few small incisions, performed by a surgeon seated at a computer console in the operating room. The procedure would be carried out using robotic arms and surgical instruments. The urologist went on to say that the robotic technology would allow for smaller incisions, better control of the instruments, lower risk of complications, and faster return of erectile function.

During the procedure, there were mechanical problems as the robotic arms were not responding as expected. The urologist persisted in using the robotic technology and ultimately was able to complete the procedure. The operation took twice as long as expected, but the urologist felt it had been successful.

Postoperatively, the patient developed serious bleeding requiring multiple blood transfusions. He was taken back to the operating room where it was noted the inferior epigastric artery (a key artery in the pelvis) had been damaged during the original procedure. The injury was repaired but this second operation was prolonged and complicated due to the degree of bleeding. The patient ultimately required several additional surgeries and a prolonged hospital stay.

Title: Inadvertent Use of More Potent Acid Leads to Burn

The Case:
A 31-year-old woman came to the clinic for a routine well-woman evaluation. She has a history of cervical dysplasia and vaginal warts, previously treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). She reported normal health and no health concerns. The physical exam revealed a raised lesion on the perineum, midline, just outside of the introitus. The patient described this as the area of her prior wart. The attending physician recommended placing some acetic acid on the area to evaluate the lesion and, if that showed signs concerning for vulval intra-epithelial neoplasia, they would then discuss performing a biopsy. The patient gave verbal consent for this.

The resident physician asked the medical assistant for acetic acid and unknowingly received TCA. Immediately after the application, the area turned densely white, which was abnormal for acetic acid, and that led to the discovery that TCA had been applied rather than acetic acid. The patient was immediately informed of the error and treated with sodium bicarbonate to neutralize and reverse the effects of the TCA. No TCA appeared to have come in contact with the vaginal mucosa or the labia, and after the sodium bicarbonate treatment the white area was smaller than 0.5 cm. Once the area was completely dry, petroleum jelly and lidocaine ointment were applied for comfort, and the patient was pain-free at discharge. However, one year after the event, the patient continued to complain of discoloration and discomfort.

Title: A Room Without Orders

The Case:
A 56-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital for a scheduled cycle of chemotherapy. He had no acute complaints. The patient arrived directly to the medical unit on a busy afternoon and waited in a nearby area for his assigned room. At shift change, the patient's room was ready but the nurse who had initially greeted him on arrival had been replaced by a new nurse, who escorted the patient to his room. The nurse completed the usual check-in process later in the evening but did not contact the admitting provider, making the assumption this had occurred several hours earlier. Therefore, no admitting orders were written.

The patient spent the night in the hospital and took his own insulin, which he had brought from home. No evening meal was delivered; the patient thought that holding his food was part of his chemo regimen so he didn't question this. Since he wasn't complaining of any symptoms and takes few medications at home, he didn't prompt the need for any orders overnight.

The following morning, the new nurse (the third in his care so far) noted the patient was difficult to arouse. She went to review the existing orders and discovered they were completely absent. She paged the on-call team who immediately evaluated the patient and successfully treated him for symptomatic hypoglycemia, which had been caused by the patient's insulin taking effect in the absence of food intake. The case prompted a formal review as, in addition to the preventable episode of hypoglycemia, the initiation of his scheduled chemotherapy was delayed.

================================================================================

Title: New Patient Mistakenly Checked in as Another

The Case:
A 55-year-old man, presented to a primary care physician's office for an initial visit to establish care and obtain routine health maintenance. He had not seen a physician in some time, but since his older brother had recently had a heart attack, he wanted to ask a physician if he should have his cholesterol checked and what else he could do to reduce his risk of heart disease.

Unknown to him, the physician he selected had another patient with the exact same first and last name, who was also 55 years of age but had a different birthday. The office receptionist was new to the practice, had not yet met most of the patients, and was struggling to become familiar with the practice's newly installed electronic medical record (EMR). She logged in and quickly found the chart of a patient with the same age and name of the patient who was registering. Assuming this must be the same patient, she checked the "new" patient in under the "old" patient's medical record number.

The physician examined the patient and advised that given his age and family history, he should have a fasting lipid panel checked. She placed an electronic order for the lab tests to be performed, and the patient had blood drawn the next day. The test results showed a slightly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, so the physician sent the results to the patient via the EMR's patient portal, along with a note advising him to modify his diet and engage in a weight loss program for the next 3 months.

Because of the mistake made when registering the patient, the test results and email from the physician actually went to theotherpatient—the one who was an established patient of the practice. When he logged into the patient portal, he was surprised, as he had not had any labs drawn recently. Moreover, he was already taking medication to reduce his cholesterol. He called the office and told them that there seemed to be a mix-up with his test results. Only then was the registration error noticed.

Title: Managing Ascites: Hazards of Fluid Removal

The Case:
A 50-year-old man with longstanding alcoholic cirrhosis presented to the emergency department (ED) with several days of progressive abdominal pain and worsening distension. He had no fevers or other infectious symptoms, bleeding, or recent changes to his medications. He also reported that his last drink was more than a year ago, reflecting a behavior change motivated by his desire for liver transplant consideration. In the ED, he was afebrile with normal vital signs and no evidence of jaundice. His abdominal exam was notable for marked distension with a fluid wave and a bedside ultrasound that confirmed significant ascites. The patient last required a paracentesis several months earlier for similar symptom relief. His laboratory results were notable for a stable anemia, a low platelet count of 50, an elevated INR of 2.5, and a mild transaminitis and leukocytosis. In the ED, his working diagnosis was acute decompensation of cirrhosis without a clear etiology.

Eager to relieve his symptoms, the providers performed a large volume paracentesis. While there was discussion about "how much to take off," the patient became acutely hypotensive as the 10th liter of fluid was being removed. The hypotension failed to respond to initial fluid resuscitation, and the patient required a short duration of vasopressors in the intensive care unit before being weaned off. He was ultimately discharged after a 3-day hospitalization with an increase in his outpatient diuretic regimen and close follow-up in the liver clinic. The case prompted a formal review since the entire hospitalization was deemed preventable given the belief that his hypotension was a direct result of the aggressive fluid removal attempts.

================================================================================

Title: Hyperglycemia and Switching to Subcutaneous Insulin

The Case:
A 47-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was admitted to the hospital with nonketotic hyperglycemia due to medication nonadherence. He was placed on a transitional care (step-down) unit and the decision was made to start an intravenous (IV) insulin drip to control his hyperglycemia. This hospital used the Glucommander—a computer-based system that recommends insulin and IV fluid infusion rates based on the patient's blood glucose levels—for protocol-based management of hyperglycemia. The admitting physician entered initial orders into the Glucommander, and the system recommended changes to the infusions based on subsequent blood glucose measurements. Within several hours, the patient's blood sugars improved from over 600 to less than 200, so, per the protocol, his insulin infusion was decreased and the IV fluids were changed to D5 1/2 NS (hypotonic saline with added dextrose).

That evening, the patient began to experience chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed T-wave inversions in the lateral leads, prompting concern for cardiac ischemia. The cross-covering resident and attending saw the patient and decided to transfer him to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer monitoring. The patient was made NPO (nothing by mouth) in case an urgent cardiac procedure was required. The resident therefore decided to discontinue the Glucommander, as he did not want the patient to experience dangerously low blood sugars. Orders were written for the patient to receive sliding scale subcutaneous insulin, and his IV fluids were changed to normal saline with no added dextrose.

The patient's chest pain quickly resolved and he had no further ECG changes or evidence of cardiac ischemia. However, over the next several hours, the patient developed hyperglycemia, with blood sugars over 400. When the primary physician saw the patient the next morning, she realized that although normal protocol called for starting subcutaneous insulin 2 hours prior to discontinuing IV insulin, the patient actually did not receive any subcutaneous insulin until more than 2 hours after the infusion was stopped. As a result, the patient's blood sugars rapidly rose. This required him to remain in the ICU for an additional day in order to adequately manage his hyperglycemia, and led to a longer hospital stay. On review of the incident, the resident admitted that he had never actually transitioned a patient off the Glucommander to subcutaneous insulin, and the ICU nurse also had limited experience with this technology.

================================================================================

Title: An Obstructed View

The Case:
A 66-year-old man with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the emergency department (ED) with subacute abdominal pain that had become much worse the previous evening. He reported relatively mild abdominal pain for the past 2–3 weeks, which was described as in his "mid-abdomen and crampy." The previous night, soon after eating dinner, he developed severe mid-abdominal pain that did not radiate and did not remit. He had never experienced abdominal pain of this severity. He reported no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. He did report occasional constipation but had a normal bowel movement the day prior to presentation. The patient had never had a colonoscopy. On initial evaluation, the patient had stable vital signs, a tender abdomen without rebound or guarding, and unremarkable laboratory test results. A CT of his abdomen/pelvis noted mild dilation of the ascending, transverse, and proximal descending colon with associated air-fluid levels in the ileum and a possible "transition point concerning for stricture/mass or physiologic peristalsis."

Because the patient appeared well, he was admitted to the medicine (instead of surgery) service for observation, pain control, and serial abdominal exams. Surgical consultation was not requested at time of admission. Approximately 48 hours into the hospitalization, the patient's abdomen became more distended, with increased abdominal pain and tenderness with rebound on exam. A surgical consultation was requested. After the surgeons reviewed the imaging and performed a physical examination, they took the patient urgently to the operating room, where an obstructive mass with associated perforation was noted. The patient had a prolonged postoperative course with intra-abdominal infection before ultimately dying. The institution formally reviewed the case because of concerns regarding a possible delay in treatment and surgical consultation.

================================================================================

Title: Amphotericin Toxicity

The Case:
A 42-year-old woman status-post left pneumonectomy for aspergilloma was being treated with oral posaconazole for residual fungal disease. She presented to the outpatient infectious disease (ID) clinic with 2 weeks of pain, erythema, and purulent drainage around her sternotomy site. She was diagnosed with sternal osteomyelitis with multiple areas of fluid collections, felt to be due to contiguous spread from her aspergilloma. After surgical debridement, tissue cultures revealedAspergillus fumigatus.

Per ID consultation, the patient was switched from posaconazole to intravenous (IV) liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for presumed posaconazole treatment failure. Hours into the IV infusion, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and rigors. The next morning, it was discovered that she had been given conventional amphotericin B (Fungizone) at the intended 5 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B dose. When treating aspergillosis, conventional amphotericin is dosed at a maximum of 1–1.5 mg/kg. Thus, the administered dose represented a 5-fold overdose. The patient developed acute kidney injury, which subsequently subsided, and she ultimately was discharged home with IV caspofungin to finish her course of antifungal therapy.

Multiple factors contributed to this error. First, the resident on the consulting ID team, unfamiliar with the different formulations of amphotericin B, did not distinguish between the two preparations in his progress note. He wrote for "amphotericin B" in his note, while the attending ID note specified "Ambisome" at 5 mg/kg. The primary service (thoracic surgery) inadvertently prescribed conventional amphotericin B (Fungizone) at the ID consult–recommended dose of 5 mg/kg. Second, the electronic prescribing system lacked an alert for the conventional amphotericin formulation that would have notified the prescribing physician that the dose was out of the recommended range. Third, the pharmacist filling the prescription was also unfamiliar with the different amphotericin formulations and did not recognize the toxic dose, either while compounding the medication or sending it to the floor. Finally, the nurse administering the infusion (given during shift change) did not recognize that the patient was having an infusion reaction. Consequently, the infusion was allowed to run to completion. The dosing error was not identified until the next morning.

While not irreversibly harmed, the patient experienced an infusion reaction and acute kidney injury. Her hospital stay was extended for 3 extra days. She was discharged home with a PICC line for prolonged IV caspofungin therapy (a suboptimal antifungal agent for treating aspergillosis), due to her fear of receiving more amphotericin. Had she received the proper medication at the proper dose during her admission, she may have not needed the PICC line at all.

Title: The Risks of Absent Interoperability: Medication-Induced Hemolysis in a Patient With a Known Allergy

The Case:
A 47-year-old man with paraplegia (secondary to a gunshot wound) and a history of polysubstance abuse presented to the emergency department (ED) of Hospital Y late in the evening with pain and fever. The patient reported he had been to four different hospitals in the past few weeks and recently left against medical advice from Hospital X that morning to celebrate his birthday. Outside records from Hospital X obtained by the ED were scanty but revealed that the patient had presented with sepsis and had received antibiotics and intravenous fluids for presumed infection prior to leaving.

He was diagnosed, again, with sepsis secondary to sacral decubitus ulcers. He was given intravenous fluids, started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and admitted to the hospital for further management. During the day, he appeared to be improving on antibiotics. At approximately 3 AM, the patient was found unresponsive by his nurse. A code blue was called, and he was noted to be in PEA [pulseless electrical activity] arrest. He achieved return of spontaneous circulation after 4 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Upon arrival to the ICU, his hemoglobin was undetectable, and clinicians determined that the arrest was secondary to massive intravascular hemolysis (acute rupturing of his red blood cells). Based on the clinical presentation, the hemolysis was presumed to have been caused by a reaction to the piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient was transfused with 8 units of packed red blood cells and his hemoglobin improved. Unfortunately, his cardiac arrest led to an anoxic brain injury, and he remained in a vegetative state.

Later that day, previously requested records arrived from three hospitals where the patient had been cared for recently. One record revealed that he had experienced piperacillin-tazobactam–induced hemolysis last month, resulting in cardiac arrest and a 2-week ICU stay. This severe life-threatening allergic reaction was not known to any providers in the current hospital. On admission, the patient reported no allergies to medications, but he did state that he had "a reaction to a transfusion" where "my white cells were attacking my red cells and my heart stopped." In light of this answer (and the absence of data from the other hospitals), he was noted to have no medication allergies.

After 3 weeks in the hospital, the patient was transferred to a long-term care facility with a poor likelihood of recovery.
