Title: The Wrong Blade: A Lack of Familiarity With Pediatric Emergency Equipment

The Case:
As part of aprospective multicenter cohort study, 58 interprofessional teams—each comprised of 1–2 physicians, 3–5 nurses, and 2–3 nursing assistants or emergency medical technician personnel—were evaluated in their native pediatric or general emergency department (ED) resuscitation bays as they managed a series of 3 simulated critically ill patients (sepsis, seizure, and cardiac arrest). The simulated cardiac resuscitation case was a 5-year-old boy, found pulseless and apneic in the bathtub by a parent. All of the teams used the Broselow system, a proprietary system designed to facilitate finding the appropriate-sized resuscitation equipment for ill and injured children requiring lifesaving interventions.

In the simulation case reviews, it was noted that many of the teams had difficulty with the resuscitation because of a lack of interoperability between the prestocked disposable laryngoscope blades and handles on the Broselow cart with the ED's actual stock of blades and handles. This incompatibility led to significant delays in intubation; at times, it led to actual failure to intubate. For example, the teams, who usually did not recognize the problem with compatibility, spent unnecessary time replacing batteries and the like. Some called for backup airway teams, resulting in delays in treatment. If this case were to actually occur, it is likely that many of the teams would have made significant errors in handling the intubation equipment that would likely have led to patient harm or even death.

Title: Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards

The Case:
A 67-year-old woman with cancer was admitted to the hospital to begin a chemotherapy cycle of IV etoposide (daily for 3 days) and IV cisplatin (a single dose). The chemotherapy order was sent to the hospital's cancer center satellite pharmacy, where the pharmacist entered the order into the computer. She prepared the first doses of etoposide and cisplatin, which were scheduled for administration on a Friday.

Inadvertently, while transcribing the order, the pharmacist switched the duration of therapy for the two agents, entering a single dose of etoposide and 3 days of cisplatin therapy. The patient received the correct doses on the first day (since the transposition didn't affect this); however, the subsequent days' doses were incorrect. The second day of therapy fell on a Saturday, and the satellite pharmacy was closed for the weekend. Doses for day 2 of therapy were therefore prepared in a different pharmacy, by a pharmacist who did not have access to the original chemotherapy order. The weekend pharmacist instead received a computer-generated label for cisplatin, verified the dose was appropriate for the patient's body surface area, and prepared the dose without realizing the patient had already received cisplatin the day before. Thus, cisplatin was labeled and dispensed according to the incorrectly transcribed order.

When the dose reached the bedside, the patient's nurse was in a hurry and bypassed the double-check policy of having a second nurse verify the chemotherapy order prior to administration. The nursing and pharmacy medication profiles were actually on different systems, so the nursing profile reflected the original correct order while the pharmacy profile reflected the incorrectly transcribed order. The patient ultimately received a second dose of cisplatin instead of the intended dose of etoposide.

Immediately after the cisplatin had been administered, the nurse reread the original order, recognized the error, and contacted the pharmacy and physician. In subsequent days, the patient's renal function began to deteriorate, and she required hemodialysis several times during the hospitalization. Luckily, the patient recovered and no longer needed dialysis by the time of discharge.

In response to the event, the hospital established a policy requiring original chemotherapy orders to be used as a double check following initial doses and reviewed strategies to improve interoperability of the technology involved in the processing and administration of chemotherapy orders.

================================================================================

Title: Mixup Beyond the Medication Label

The Case:
An 80-year-old man was admitted to a hospital for recurrent hypoglycemia. He had been seen at another hospital 2 weeks earlier for a similar episode, with a glucose level of 26 mg/dL. He was treated and released without a diagnosis at that time. Despite extensive diagnostic workup during the current admission, physicians could not identify the cause of hypoglycemia. Once his glucose level normalized, he was discharged home.

Approximately 2 weeks after the second discharge, the patient experienced another severe hypoglycemic episode and was admitted to a different hospital. At this time, his glucose level was 36 mg/dL; concurrent insulin level was 36.7 mIU/L (normal fasting level

However, the consulting endocrinologist recommended the family bring in all of the patient's medication bottles. The family returned with 12 different medications, none of which were labeled as an oral hypoglycemic agent. The resident used the codes on each pill to identify them and discovered that one bottle labeled as "doxazosin (Cardura)" actually contained the sulfonylurea, glimepiride (Amaryl) 4 mg. The patient had no history of diabetes, which likely suggested a pharmacy filling error. He had no further hypoglycemic episodes once this error was identified and corrected.

================================================================================

Title: An Untimely End Despite End-of-Life Care Planning

The Case:
A 76-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a cardiac arrest and loss of cardiac function for about 15 minutes. Afterward, the patient displayed worsening neurological status and a CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema and anoxic injury. The ICU team initiated conversation with the patient's family to establish goals of care.

After extensive discussions, the family agreed to a DNR [do not resuscitate] order for the patient, but they wanted more time before making a decision about transitioning to comfort care. The patient continued to decline, with loss of brain stem reflexes. After another week of conversations with the ICU team, including consultation from the palliative care service, the family decided to discontinue life-sustaining therapies and agreed to comfort measures and terminal extubation. Orders were written and the respiratory therapist and the patient's nurse were informed.

However, within a half hour of these actions, the family asked to speak with the ICU resident, reversed their prior decision, and stated that they wanted more time before transitioning to comfort measures. The ICU resident, who had been involved in the prior conversations, canceled the terminal extubation orders. However, this occurred at the end of shift, and the resident did not verbally communicate the order change to other members of the team. Another nurse who had been involved in the previous conversations found the canceled orders after the resident left, thought this was an error, and asked another physician, who was also unaware of the change in plans, to reinstate the terminal extubation orders. The patient was extubated. When the patient's daughter arrived shortly thereafter, she was very upset to find her father extubated. Eventually, the senior ICU team members were able to intervene and speak with the daughter to explain and apologize for the lack of communication. The patient died within few hours.

================================================================================

Title: Primary Workaround, Secondary Complication

The Case:
A young adult with a progressive neurological disorder presented to a hospital emergency department (ED) from a nursing home with a dislodged gastrojejunostomy (GJ) tube. The patient had a history of multiple GJ tube dislodgements over the prior several months. When the GJ tube was dislodged, nursing home staff inserted a Foley catheter into the ostomy and inflated the Foley bulb in the stomach to maintain patency. The distal portion of the Foley catheter was tied in a loose knot but not otherwise secured (Figure 1). The catheter was in place on arrival to the ED. When the patient was taken to interventional radiology for GJ tube placement (Figure 2), there was no Foley noted; a new GJ tube was successfully inserted.

The patient was discharged back to the nursing home but readmitted 2 days later with fever and increasing abdominal distention. An abdominal CT scan showed an obstructing foreign body in the small bowel, initially thought to be a retained segment of the previously dislodged GJ tube. Surgical consultation was obtained, but nonsurgical intervention was recommended due to the patient's neurological condition. The patient continued to deteriorate despite volume resuscitation, broad spectrum antibiotics, and attempts to reduce the small bowel obstruction nonsurgically. After discussion with the patient's family, comfort measures were instituted on the fourth hospital day, and the patient died shortly thereafter.

The patient's family requested an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death. At autopsy, the entire Foley catheter—with inflated balloon and distal knot—was found to be obstructing the small bowel (Figure 3). The catheter appeared to have been pulled into the small bowel by peristalsis.

A root cause analysis (RCA) revealed several missed opportunities to have prevented the patient's unfortunate outcome. First, when the Foley catheter was initially inserted through the ostomy and inflated, the potential for peristalsis to pull the Foley catheter bulb into the stomach despite the distal loose knot was not adequately considered. A more appropriate method would have been a T-clamp or similar device instead of a loose knot to secure the catheter. Second, when the patient arrived in the ED, an opportunity to further secure the Foley catheter externally was missed. Third, when the patient was in interventional radiology and the Foley catheter was not in place, an opportunity to search for the Foley catheter was missed. It was assumed that the Foley had been removed pending the procedure. Finally, the radiologist did not consider that the obstructing body might be the Foley catheter and not the retained segment of the previously dislodged GJ tube.

The results of the RCA were disclosed to the patient's family. Although they were grateful that a thorough analysis had been performed and measures would be implemented to prevent these errors, they remained concerned about the decision to insert a Foley catheter through the GJ tube site. Since this took place at the nursing home, it fell outside the hospital RCA's jurisdiction. However, hospital safety leaders realized that this practice was common for hospitalized patients as well, potentially putting many patients at risk.

================================================================================

Title: Don't Pick the PICC

The Case:
A 63-year-old man with diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy; glaucoma; and stage IV chronic kidney disease was admitted to the hospital with an ulcer on the bottom of his right foot. Physical examination revealed a 2 cm clean-based ulcer below the fifth metatarsal head of the right foot. No surrounding swelling or erythema was present, but the ulcer could be probed to the underlying bone. An MRI was highly concerning for osteomyelitis, and a bone biopsy showed chronic inflammation with cultures positive for methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus. An infectious diseases consultant recommended therapy with 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone to be given via outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy.

The interventional radiology team was consulted to place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for antibiotic therapy. They attempted the placement multiple times in the right brachial vein but failed. The line was then successfully placed in the left brachial vein. The patient's nephrologist was not consulted prior to placing the PICC line. The patient was discharged and completed 6 weeks of antibiotics and wound care, with healing of the osteomyelitis and ulcer. The PICC line was then removed.

Five months later, the patient was seen by his nephrologist and was found to have worsening renal function and hyperphosphatemia. Dialysis access planning was initiated, but unfortunately, when the patient was evaluated by a vascular surgeon, he was found not be a candidate for arteriovenous fistula placement (the safest and most effective form of dialysis access). He was thought to have poor vein quality due to the many venipuncture attempts during the PICC line placements several months previously. Instead of a fistula, the patient had an arteriovenous graft placed, and dialysis was initiated 3 months later.

The patient's nephrologist referred the case to interventional radiology and hospital medicine for review given the preventable complication. The groups collaborated to develop a protocol to review renal function in patients who have requests for PICC lines, with nephrology approval required before any long-term venous access can be placed in patients with stage III–V chronic kidney disease.

================================================================================

Title: Perils in Diagnosing a Stroke

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic back pain, and opioid use disorder was brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive. The patient's wife had been driving him back from the store when she noticed he was very lethargic. After he became unresponsive, she called 911. In the emergency department, the physician suspected a stroke given the patient's risk factors and the relatively acute onset of symptoms. A CT scan revealed no bleeding into the brain. After consulting with a neurologist, the decision was made to give systemic thrombolytics (drugs to dissolve a blood clot).

After the thrombolytic was administered, the patient's nurse noticed multiple patches on the patient's back. She realized that they were fentanyl patches—a potent opioid medication. She spoke with the patient's wife, who said that the patient was prescribed the patches for his chronic back pain and that she had placed two fentanyl patches on the patient earlier that morning. The patient's wife stated his physician had recently increase the dose due to his pain level. The nurse asked a pharmacy technician to perform medication reconciliation, which revealed that the patient's fentanyl patch had recently been increased from 100 micrograms per hour to 150 micrograms per hour. However, his wife had accidentally applied two 150 microgram patches that morning—instead of one—as she assumed the two patches would be his new regimen. Therefore, the patient had inadvertently received three times his previous dose of fentanyl.

The nurse alerted the physician, who realized that the opioid overdose probably explained the patient's symptoms. He quickly ordered administration of naloxone (an opioid reversal agent). Although the patient initially became more responsive, shortly thereafter he had a generalized seizure. A repeat CT scan showed intracranial hemorrhage—an adverse consequence of the thrombolytics. His neurologic status deteriorated, and he required urgent surgery to drain the bleeding. The patient had a long, complex hospital course, but eventually he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with substantial (though not complete) recovery of his functional status.

================================================================================

Title: Febrile Neutropenia and an Almost Fatal Medication Error

The Case:
A 33-year-old woman with recently diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia was admitted to the oncology service for treatment with chemotherapy. She reported feeling relatively well, apart from mild fatigue secondary to anemia. For chronic constipation, she took sennosides daily and polyethylene glycol as needed.

On admission to the hospital, her vital signs were stable, and physical examination was notable only for conjunctival pallor. Chemotherapy was administered as scheduled over 5 days. As expected, her blood counts dropped in response to the chemotherapy, and on hospital day 6 she was noted to be neutropenic with an absolute neutrophil count of 320. That night, she noted some abdominal discomfort. The bedside nurse noted that the patient had not had a bowel movement for the last 2 days despite taking both sennosides and polyethylene glycol daily. The nurse paged the overnight physician, who ordered a suppository without realizing that the patient was neutropenic and immunosuppressed after recent chemotherapy. The nurse administered the suppository as ordered, unaware that suppositories are contraindicated in neutropenic patients.

Several hours later, the patient felt warm and developed shaking chills. Repeat vital signs revealed a fever to 39.7°C and a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, concerning for sepsis. The nurse paged the overnight physician once again. Blood cultures were drawn and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started for febrile neutropenia. The patient worsened clinically and required transfer to the intensive care unit for hypotension and management of septic shock. Her blood cultures ultimately grewEscherichia coli, which may have spread from her bowel to her bloodstream as a result of receiving the suppository. Ultimately, she recovered and was discharged home a week later.

================================================================================

Title: Suicide Risk in the Hospital

The Case:
A 37-year-old woman with a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder presented to the emergency department (ED) after a suicide attempt. She overdosed on 3–4 tablets each of alprazolam (a sedative) and gabapentin (a pain medication) and then cut both of her forearms with a kitchen knife. Upon presentation to the ED, the patient endorsed active suicidality. She had no previous suicide attempts. Her physical examination was significant for a tearful, depressed affect and superficial lacerations to the bilateral forearms, including a 3 cm laceration on the left forearm.

The patient's left forearm laceration was sutured and bandaged with gauze padding. The patient was observed for a period of several hours postingestion, and she was evaluated by a psychiatrist who placed an involuntary legal hold due to high risk of self-harm. She was then transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit. On arriving to the unit, the patient asked to use the bathroom. She then unwrapped the gauze bandage from her wrist, wrapped it around her neck and over the shower bar in the bathroom, and attempted to hang herself.

Fortunately, a staff member heard a noise from the bathroom, immediately entered, and cut the gauze before the patient was seriously injured. The patient was transferred back to the ED, where she was found to have superficial abrasions to her neck but an otherwise normal physical exam. A CT scan of the head and cervical spine was obtained, which was normal. She was ultimately readmitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit for further treatment of her depression and suicidality.

================================================================================

Title: Root Cause Analysis Gone Wrong

The Case:
A 42-year-old man with history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis was awaiting a kidney transplant. A suitable donor was identified, and the patient was taken to the operating room for the procedure. The surgery was uneventful, and the transplanted kidney was connected successfully. As the procedure was drawing to a close, the surgeon instructed the anesthesiologist to give 3000 units of intravenous heparin (an anticoagulant) as part of the standard protocol to prevent graft thrombosis.

The surgical team was preparing to close the incision when the clinicians noticed blood in the surgical field. They performed a careful search for bleeding, but did not find a clear source, and the bleeding continued to worsen. The patient's blood pressure began to drop, and transfusions were administered while the team tried to stop the bleeding. At that point, the anesthesiologist reviewed the medications and realized that he had accidentally administered 30,000 units of heparin—not 3000 units. He immediately administered protamine to reverse the anticoagulant effect. However, the persistent bleeding and hypotension had irreversibly damaged the transplanted kidney. The kidney was explanted, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in critical condition. The error was disclosed to the patient and his family, and he eventually recovered and was discharged home. He continued to receive hemodialysis while awaiting another transplant.

The hospital planned to perform a root cause analysis (RCA) to investigate the adverse event. The transplant surgeon was furious about the error and complained angrily to the operating room staff, chief of anesthesiology, and chief medical officer (CMO) about the "incompetence" that had resulted in the error. Although the hospital's patient safety officer attempted to conduct the RCA in a nonjudgmental fashion, she found it very difficult to focus the investigation on possible systems issues, as it seemed that all the personnel involved had already decided the anesthesiologist was to blame. The transplant surgeon was influential at the hospital, and under pressure from the CMO, the chief of anesthesiology decided to dismiss the anesthesiologist. The RCA was completed, but the conclusions focused only on the individual anesthesiologist, and no interventions to prevent similar errors or address systems issues were ever implemented.

================================================================================

Title: Walking Patient, Missing Drain

The Case:
A 43-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer was admitted to the hospital for an elective lumbar drain placement to treat hydrocephalus and elevated intracranial pressures. Because of the pressure on her brain, the patient had symptoms including mood changes, headaches, and appetite changes. Following the procedure, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring under the care of the ICU team and neurosurgery team. She made progress with recovery as expected and participated in physical therapy. On day 5 of her hospitalization, the physical therapist administered vigorous therapy (as prescribed) with the patient out of bed. The therapist returned the patient to bed at the end of the therapy session. While resting in bed after the session, the patient complained of headaches, decreased appetite, and worsening visual problems. Since the complaints were similar to the patient's symptoms on admission, which should have been addressed by the lumbar drain, the nurse attributed the patient's complaints to depression and took no action, allowing the patient to sleep and keeping unchanged the prescribed frequency of neuro checks every 6 hours while awake.



Early in the morning, the patient was found to be barely arousable. The nurse and the team then discovered that lumbar drain had dislodged and was now on the floor. A stat CT scan was ordered, which revealed extensive hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain was placed emergently at the bedside after securing the patient's airway. Eventually the patient had a new lumbar drain placement, with improvement of her mental status and other complaints. She was ultimately extubated and discharged to home.



================================================================================

Title: Air on the Side of Caution

The Case:
A young woman with morbid obesity was scheduled for cardiac catheterization to evaluate shortness of breath and chest pain. A decision was made to use a radial artery approach. Positioning the patient appropriately was challenging because she could not move easily. After multiple attempts, the team was able to access her radial artery. After the catheter was inserted, the patient began to experience increasing pain and pressure in both her arm and her chest. The team proceeded quickly with the procedure, but they hesitated to administer additional pain medication given the patient's body habitus and concern for respiratory suppression. Anesthesia was not consulted.

Review of the angiogram demonstrated the presence of an air embolism in the left coronary artery, caused by air being introduced into the patient's radial artery during the catheter insertion. It became clear that, because of the procedure's difficulty, the cardiac technician controlling the syringe for injecting dye failed to hold the syringe at the proper angle to prevent an air bubble from being introduced into the patient's vessel. When the air embolism was recognized, appropriate treatment protocols were implemented. The patient was ultimately transferred to a higher level of care, treated appropriately, and discharged from the hospital several days later.

Further review revealed that the team was under significant time pressure to perform the procedure, and many members were fatigued, as it had been a long day without breaks. Music playing in the background may also have created a distraction. In addition, during the procedure a Code Blue had been called in the room next door, which meant that several key personnel were not present for this patient's catheterization.

================================================================================

Title: Missing ECG and Missed Diagnosis Lead to Dangerous Delay

The Case:
A 35-year-old woman with no prior cardiac history called 911 after developing severe chest pressure at home. Based on the availability of local resources, a Basic Life Support Unit was dispatched. When emergency medical services (EMS) arrived at the patient's home, EMS providers obtained a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and administered aspirin. The ECG tracing showed ST elevations consistent with a large anterior wall myocardial infarction, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). According to protocol, EMS providers were required to transmit the ECG to the emergency department (ED) to activate "Code STEMI" while en route so that the cardiac catheterization laboratory, as well as necessary cardiology providers and staff, would be ready to treat the patient upon arrival to the hospital. Unfortunately, the ECG was not successfully transmitted to the ED (for technical reasons), which meant that the STEMI team was not activated in advance of the patient's arrival.

When the patient arrived in the ED, the clinicians (unaware of the original ECG) obtained a new ECG, which did not demonstrate the previously noted ST segment elevations. The patient's chest pain also seemed to be improving. She was treated with opioids for mild ongoing pain, and no additional ECGs or laboratory tests were ordered. She was subsequently admitted to the inpatient telemetry floor for overnight monitoring. The next morning, the patient's laboratory test results were notable for an elevated troponin level, suggesting that significant myocardial damage had occurred. Repeat ECG showed findings consistent with a large heart attack the prior day. She was rushed to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because PCI had been delayed for many hours from the time of the original STEMI, the patient experienced significant loss of cardiac muscle function. She ultimately required placement of a device to assist her heart function and a prolonged stay in the cardiac intensive care unit.

================================================================================

Title: Shortcuts to Acetaminophen-induced Liver Failure

The Case:
An 18-year-old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, presented to the emergency department (ED) after a week of respiratory congestion, nausea, and fever. She was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory infection, given IV fluids and acetaminophen, and discharged home with advice to continue taking acetaminophen as needed to control the fever. Thirty hours later, the patient returned to the ED with continued symptoms and new abdominal cramps. She was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and discharged with ondansetron and bismuth subsalicylate. Two days later, she presented again to the ED, this time with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. She was admitted to the ward and physical examination revealed lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, and generalized abdominal tenderness. Influenza B polymerase chain reaction was positive and Oseltamivir was started. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, transaminitis in the thousands, and lactic acidosis. The patient was admitted to the hospital and given broad-spectrum antibiotics and a diagnosis of "influenza/possible sepsis." Further questioning revealed the patient had taken 1 g of acetaminophen every 4 hours since her initial ED visit. However, despite evidence of acute fulminant hepatitis due to chronic acetaminophen overdose, the antidote, N-acetylcysteine, was held for 10 hours because acetaminophen levels were less than 10 mcg/mL, deemed to be below the toxic level. The patient recovered over the next 24 hours with conservative management and N-acetylcysteine.

================================================================================

Title: Right Place, Right Drug, Wrong Strength

The Case:
A 2-year-old girl was admitted to a hospital burn unit for a 10% total body surface area burn on her face, upper chest, and back. She was being treated with oral acetaminophen around the clock and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed for pain and discomfort. The patient underwent dressing changes and burn inspection every third day. On these days, she was also given oxycodone, which was highly effective and allowed her to rest the whole day.

One week into the hospital stay, the mother noticed the patient's breathing was very shallow after a dressing change. On examination, the patient was difficult to arouse and lethargic, and an arterial blood gas revealed CO2 retention and hypoxemia. While preparing to intubate, the physician reviewed that day's medications to identify possible causes of this sudden change in respiratory status. He discovered the patient had received oxycodone 3 times in less than 8 hours (1 dose prior to the dressing change and 2 doses after). The nurse checked the automated dispensing machine in which the oxycodone was stored and was surprised to find a higher concentration of oxycodone solution stored in place of the typical, lower concentration pediatric solution. Consequently, the dose administered to the patient was almost 5 times what was ordered.

After the physician and nurse recognized the error, the patient immediately received multiple doses of naloxone. Her breathing improved quickly, and intubation was avoided. The patient was monitored in the hospital for 1 week after the incident, did well, and was safely discharged home.

Root cause analysis (RCA) by the safety committee determined the higher concentration of oxycodone solution was incorrectly placed in the automated dispensing machine by a pharmacist who was working per diem. The RCA also found that the nurse did not check the concentration of the medication to be administered against the order written by the physician.

After the incident, multiple checkpoints were established in the pharmacy and a new protocol was established, with a special focus on pediatric medication doses. In-service training was provided to all the pharmacists, including those who work irregular shifts (e.g., overnight).

================================================================================

Title: Returning Home Safely

The Case:
A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after a fall at home resulting in a right humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation, as well as other injuries including a right knee contusion. During his admission, the patient underwent right shoulder reduction surgery with plan to keep his arm in a sling until reassessment in 1 month. Given the extent of his injuries and the need for ongoing physical therapy, the plan was made to admit the patient to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for continued rehabilitation.

The patient lived alone and had little social support. His primary care physician (PCP) suspected that the patient might have dementia, and the results of a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Kohlman Evaluation of Living Skills assessment performed during the hospitalization raised concerns about the patient's ability to continue to live independently in the community. The hospital's social worker started the process of applying for In-Home Supportive Services and Meals on Wheels, and referred the patient to a home care agency to provide home physical therapy and home nursing visits. However, the final arrangements for these services could not be completed before the patient was discharged, so the trauma team communicated these recommendations to the patient's PCP and the SNF in their discharge summary.

The patient was discharged home from the SNF after a 4-week stay. Three days later, his neighbor brought him to the clinic for an urgent appointment with his PCP. The patient appeared distressed and was complaining of right shoulder pain. His arm remained in a sling, and he was unclear about his medication regimen. His neighbor reported that the patient had not left his apartment since being discharged from the SNF because he was having difficulty climbing the stairs, and he appeared to lack access to food, medications, or transportation to his appointments. The PCP had not received any communication from the SNF about the patient's discharge.

Fortunately, the clinic's social worker followed up on the prior referrals and arranged a home nursing visit and transportation to future appointments. The neighbor also agreed to help with obtaining the patient's medications. The patient did not need to be readmitted to the hospital and was able to stay at home, but the PCP felt frustrated that the patient had not had a better discharge plan.

================================================================================

Title: A Costly Colonoscopy Leads to a Delay in Diagnosis

The Case:
A 50-year-old man presented to a primary care clinic to establish care, as he had recently switched health insurance. As part of age-appropriate cancer screening, the primary care provider ordered a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) to screen for colon cancer. When FIT returned positive, the physician called the patient to inform him of the results and explained that a colonoscopy was the appropriate next step in the diagnostic process. The medical assistant contacted the patient with instructions for scheduling the colonoscopy.

Two months later, the clinic's nurse called the patient to see if he had obtained the colonoscopy. The patient reported that he was unable to schedule the colonoscopy due to cost. His health insurance required a 30% copayment for the test, which amounted to $2000 out-of-pocket. The clinic instructed the patient to contact his insurance company again. The clinic nurse followed up with the patient a few months later. Although the patient had contacted the insurance company multiple times, he was repeatedly informed that he would be responsible for 30% of the cost. The primary care provider spoke with the clinic's social worker who assessed options for financial assistance but could not find any for which the patient was eligible.

Ultimately, the primary care provider called the insurance company directly and was informed that if the indication for the colonoscopy was changed fromdiagnostictopreventive(for screening purposes), the test would be 100% covered (the full cost of preventive colonoscopies is covered under the Affordable Care Act). Because the colonoscopy represented the second step in the colon cancer screening process after a positive FIT, the primary care provider changed the indication for the test and the patient was eventually able to obtain the colonoscopy without any out-of-pocket cost. Because the initial communication about the out-of-pocket cost was between the patient and insurance company, the patient did not know to inform the insurance company that the colonoscopy was for screening purposes (rather than diagnostic purposes, as initially coded by the primary care physician) and that the copayment should have been waived. The colonoscopy demonstrated colon cancer; the diagnosis was made more than 6 months after the positive FIT. Luckily, the delay had no impact on his clinical outcome.

================================================================================

Title: Slow Down: Right Drug, Wrong Formulation

The Case:
A 65-year-old man presented to his primary care clinic for follow-up after a recent hospitalization for exacerbation of heart failure. His past medical history was significant for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. The physician noted the patient, once again, showed several other signs of decompensated heart failure and sent him back to the hospital for intravenous (IV) diuretic therapy and control of his atrial fibrillation. The admitting internal medicine resident, in concert with the cardiology consult team, initiated IV diuresis and restarted the patient's home beta-blocker and antihypertensive medications. The patient reportedly had not taken his beta-blocker in the 36 hours prior to admission. As the evening progressed, the patient developed increasing oxygen requirements, decreasing blood pressure, and worsening mental status. That night, he developed atrioventricular block, experienced a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest, and died.

As part of the clinical review process, the case was discussed in a morbidity and mortality conference. The review revealed the patient's home medication was metoprolol succinate 300 mg. Instead, metoprolol tartrate 300 mg was ordered on hospital admission and administered as a single dose. In the institution's computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, the first formulation of metoprolol to populate into the ordering field was "Metoprolol Tab," which the system defined as metoprolol tartrate. Metoprolol succinate populated as "Metoprolol *Do Not Crush* SA" with "SA" standing for "sustained action," not "short acting."

The ordering physician was clear in chart documentation that the intent was to start extended-release metoprolol. Thus, the ordering of metoprolol tartrate at that dose was a prescribing error believed to have contributed to the patient's death. The review also determined that insufficient attention to human factors in the electronic health record played a significant role in the error and highlighted an opportunity for future enhancement of the CPOE system to include human factors thinking in the design.

================================================================================

Title: Miscommunication in the OR Leads to Anticoagulation Mishap

The Case:
A 63-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes was scheduled to undergo bilateral femoral artery embolectomy. Eight months previously, he had experienced a myocardial infarction and was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Six days prior to surgery, as instructed by the surgeon, he stopped taking his aspirin and clopidogrel in order to decrease the risk of bleeding during and after the operation.

On the day of surgery, just prior to anesthesia induction, the team conducted a preoperative briefing, using the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist. The patient's identity, the operation, the surgical site, and the anesthesia plan were verified. The surgeon told the anesthesiologist that the patient would benefit from epidural analgesia continued into the perioperative period. However, he failed to mention that postoperatively the patient would be therapeutically anticoagulated with enoxaparin for several days. The anesthesiologist was new to the hospital and unfamiliar with the postoperative management of patients undergoing femoral artery embolectomy. After surgery, no formal postoperative debrief was conducted. Unaware that the patient was going to be placed on enoxaparin, a blood thinning medication, the anesthesiologist continued orders for epidural analgesia and the epidural catheter remained in place.

The patient was started on enoxaparin per the surgeon's order. Five days later, the epidural catheter was removed. Fortunately, the patient did not experience bleeding, a potential and sometimes devastating complication of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with epidural catheters.

Title: Over-the-Counter Oversight

The Case:
A 56-year-old man was evaluated in the burn clinic for a second-degree burn on his chest. Although portions of his skin were healing well, the patient was told that he would require skin grafting to ensure a complete recovery. He was scheduled for a preoperative evaluation prior to the date of surgery. During the preoperative visit, the patient's prescription medications were reviewed and updated in his medical record. During the surgery, the patient experienced profuse bleeding and required transfusion of multiple units of blood products. His blood counts and vital signs were closely monitored after surgery and he eventually stabilized. Postoperatively, the attending surgeon reviewed the patient's medications with him in detail and specifically asked about medications purchased over the counter. The patient reported that he purchased aspirin over the counter and had been taking one pill every day, including on the day of surgery. Although the patient had been asked about blood thinning medications at his preoperative visit, he didn't realize that he should have mentioned taking aspirin because he obtained it without a prescription and he was not specifically asked about over-the-counter medications.

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Diagnosis of Endocrinologic Emergencies

The Case:
Case #1:

A 47-year-old man with a history of hyperthyroidism and hypertension presented to the emergency department (ED) with subjective symptoms of "not feeling himself." He told the ED clinician that he had been unable to take his medications for several months due to financial difficulties. Initial evaluation revealed low-grade fever, a heart rate of 170 beats per minute, and trace lower extremity edema bilaterally. There were possible infiltrates on his chest radiograph. An electrocardiogram revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient was started on a diltiazem drip and admitted to the telemetry unit for management of his heart rhythm and possible pneumonia. He continued to have fevers and tachycardia during the first 2 hospital days despite antibiotics and fluids. On top of that, he developed lethargy and delirium.

A new hospitalist assumed care of the patient on the third hospital day. She reviewed the laboratory results and found that the patient had an undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a high level of circulating thyroid hormone—indicating a diagnosis of thyroid storm (a severely overactive thyroid gland). These laboratory tests had been ordered in the ED. Although results were available the following day, they had not been noted or acted upon. The hospitalist realized that this life-threatening syndrome almost certainly explained the patient's clinical condition. She immediately discontinued intravenous fluids, started treatment with propranolol to control the heart rate and methimazole to suppress thyroid hormone production, and consulted an endocrinologist.

However, the patient remained lethargic and developed hypoxemia over the course of the day. An echocardiogram showed a diminished ejection fraction and dilated left ventricle, consistent with a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle due to longstanding rapid heart rate). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening respiratory status. Shortly after arrival in the ICU, he went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.

Case #2:

A 53-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and mechanical aortic valve replacement was admitted with shortness of breath and lower leg swelling for several days attributed to an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure. On the second hospital day, she developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, requiring transfer to the ICU for management. She was started on an amiodarone drip and reverted to normal sinus rhythm within 12 hours. She stabilized and was discharged home on oral amiodarone therapy.

Over the next 3 months, the patient had multiple hospital admissions for presumed COPD exacerbations requiring treatment with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and oral steroids. She also developed abnormal liver function tests and was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. Eventually, she was readmitted to the hospital with hypothermia, hypotension, delirium, and continued hypoxemia. She had bilateral infiltrates on her chest radiograph and was assessed as having septic shock due to pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU and required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Her liver function worsened, and she developed pseudo-obstruction of her colon (Ogilvie syndrome) requiring decompression.

On a Saturday afternoon, well into her prolonged hospital stay, her condition worsened. The covering physician reviewed her old labs and found a very high TSH level and undetectable levels of thyroid hormone. This test had been ordered during a hospitalization one month previously, but the result was not documented in any progress notes, and there was no evidence that anyone had acted on the result. The physician realized that the result likely indicated myxedema coma—systemic illness due to lack of thyroid hormone. Her worsening respiratory status, liver abnormalities, and colonic pseudo-obstruction were all consistent with severe hypothyroidism. This thyroid dysfunction is a known complication of amiodarone therapy, but despite the patient's multiple hospitalizations and overall worsening clinical status, none of her prior physicians had recognized this diagnosis.

The patient was immediately started on levothyroxine and endocrinology was consulted. However, within 24 hours, she went into multi-organ failure and respiratory failure with hypoxia and hypercapnia. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as institution of vasopressors due to shock. Although her condition improved slightly, she could not be weaned from the ventilator and developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia. She had previously stated her wishes to avoid resuscitative measures or a prolonged ICU course. After extensive discussions with her family, the goals of care were changed to comfort measures only. She died peacefully in the ICU after a 3-week hospitalization.

================================================================================

Title: Specimen Almost Lost

The Case:
A 29-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a rash that had spread across her legs and abdomen. She was admitted to the medicine service for further evaluation and treatment of the painful, itchy rash.

To determine the etiology of the rash, she underwent a punch biopsy of her skin. The resident entered orders into the patient's electronic health record (EHR) indicating that the biopsy specimen should be sent to pathology for further evaluation. The resident also discussed the orders with the patient's nurse. The bedside nurse took the biopsy specimen to the pathology laboratory but neglected to print a copy of the resident's orders to accompany the specimen. The pathology laboratory did not have access to the same EHR as the inpatient medicine service, and the pathologist could not view the resident's orders. Without a printed copy of the orders, the biopsy specimen could not be directed to the appropriate area in the pathology laboratory for processing and analysis.

The following day, the resident attempted to look up the results of the biopsy but found none. The resident called pathology and, luckily, the laboratory had placed the specimen on hold instead of discarding it. The resident was able to print a paper order form and bring it to the laboratory so that the specimen could be processed and read by a pathologist. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein purpura and managed appropriately.

================================================================================

Title: Hyperbilirubinemia Refractory to Phototherapy

The Case:
A 1-day-old full-term infant was noted to have elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) of 14.7 mg/dL (251 μmol/L) due to hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO incompatibility). The patient was placed on a mattress with embedded phototherapy lights in the mother's postpartum room. Despite the treatment, the TSB level continued to climb, reaching 18 mg/dL (308 μmol/L).

The patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and staff began preparations for an exchange transfusion. In the meantime, a neonatologist asked that the irradiance level of the phototherapy lights be tested, and it was found to be well below the recommended level. The lights were replaced. The infant's TSB level began to drop and the exchange transfusion was aborted.

Further investigation revealed that there had been no regular testing of phototherapy light irradiance and that some of the unit's equipment had aging lights with insufficient irradiance levels. A protocol was put in place to ensure: (i) testing of irradiance levels prior to each use of the phototherapy mattresses or other device; (ii) routine monthly irradiance level testing of all phototherapy devices; and that a label is placed on each device with the date and time of the last test.

================================================================================

Title: High-Risk Medications, High-Risk Transfers

The Case:
A 47-year-old woman with history of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was admitted to the hospital for sepsis secondary to an infected intravenous (IV) line through which she was receiving IV treprostinil, a potent pulmonary vasodilator used for. Given its potential toxicity, it is categorized as a "high alert" medication. The patient's home pump was switched to another line that had been inserted in the intensive care unit (ICU). The bedside nurse received education about treprostinil, with special instructions not to flush the line as this would lead to a very large and dangerous dose. The ICU nurses were very familiar with using treprostinil in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

After the patient's infection improved and blood cultures cleared, the decision was made to have the interventional radiologistsplace a new permanent catheter. She was transferred to interventional radiology (IR) with a full treprostinil supply, and the sign-off between the ICU charge nurse and the IR department included instructions to not flush the treprostinil line.

During preparation in the IR suite for the new line placement, one of the infusion pumps started alarming. However, the charge nurse was outside the suite at that time. A radiology technician in the room attempted to identify the alarm, and in the process accidentally flushed the treprostinil line. Consequently, the patient received an excessive amount of the medication, which resulted in a near code situation. The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, which required emergent intubation.

The charge nurse entered the room while the patient was being resuscitated, recognized the error, and stopped the medication. Once the patient was stabilized, a pharmacist was consulted, and the patient was restarted on a lower dose of treprostinil to allow for elimination of the excess medication. She was extubated and eventually discharged home after a prolonged ICU stay.

After this incident, inservice training was given to all individuals involved in the use of this high-alert medication, including medical, pharmacy, and nursing staff. In addition, a new protocol was established that requires the charge nurse to escort patients during all transfers from the ICU.

================================================================================

Title: The Forgotten Radiographic Read

The Case:
A 60-year-old woman with peripheral artery disease and chronic mesenteric ischemia was admitted for management of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) stenosis. She underwent IMA and right renal artery stenting by vascular surgery and was transferred to an internal medicine teaching service for ongoing management of hyponatremia and hypertension during the second week of hospitalization.

On hospital day 18, the patient had sudden nausea and abdominal distension. The overnight cross-cover intern evaluated the patient and ordered an abdominal radiograph. Although the patient was uncomfortable, her vital signs were stable, and the intern did not observe an acute abdomen on examination. The intern read the radiograph as an ileus and attributed patient's symptoms to this; tube feeds were held. While the intern intended to contact radiology to confirm her interpretation, another patient acutely deteriorated (requiring a Code Blue activation), and she forgot to follow up on the radiograph. Early the next morning, the vascular surgery patient developed delirium, hypotension, and hypoxemia, and she was emergently transferred to the intensive care unit.

The radiograph was formally read by a radiology attending at approximately 8:00 AM. She immediately recognized portal venous gas—a sign of acute mesenteric ischemia. She contacted the primary team, who ordered a CT angiogram, which revealed internal mesenteric artery dissection, diffuse bowel ischemia, and infarction of the liver and spleen. After discussion between surgery, the primary team, and the family, the decision was made not to pursue further surgery as the expected mortality was extremely high. The patient was transitioned to comfort care and died that evening.

The case was formally reviewed by the medical service and by radiology. The reviews concluded that the delay in diagnosis of internal mesenteric artery dissection and bowel infarction represented a preventable adverse event. The major contributing factors were considered to be the workload of the overnight cross-cover intern and the lack of a formal system for obtaining radiology interpretations of radiographs performed overnight. At this hospital, the overnight staffing on the medicine service consisted of two hospitalists, two senior residents, and one intern, but the intern was "first call" for all acute issues overnight. The radiology department had two residents in house overnight, but provided interpretation only for emergency department studies, CT scans, and MRIs performed overnight. Regular radiographs were not formally read until the morning, unless specifically requested.

================================================================================

Title: Failed Interpretation of Screening Tool: Delayed Treatment

The Case:
An 88-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of upper back pain. His medical history was significant for hypertension and longstanding mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation. His initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 130/75 mm hg, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, temperature of 36.3°C, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Physical examination revealed a frail elderly man in no distress. He had normal heart sounds and a soft systolic murmur heard best at the apex; his lungs showed faint bilateral crackles. He had no spinal tenderness and a normal neurological examination, including mental status. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable. Initial laboratory investigation demonstrated a normal white blood cell count, serum lactate, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function. A chest radiograph showed hilar fullness and mild bilateral infiltrates, consistent with pulmonary edema or early pneumonia.

The emergency physician assessed the patient as having either new onset congestive heart failure or an atypical pneumonia. She considered starting antibiotics but held off as the patient looked well and did not "screen positive" for sepsis. (The hospital had recently implemented a formal sepsis screening system for all ED patients.) The patient was admitted for workup of his hypoxemia. The admitting internist also deferred starting antibiotics, in part guided by the negative sepsis screening. He ordered an echocardiogram for the next morning and prescribed diuretic medications. At the time of ward admission (4 hours after presentation), the patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

Early the next morning, the patient acutely decompensated with worsened hypoxemia, hypotension, and delirium. He remained afebrile, but repeat labs now showed a markedly elevated serum lactate level and white blood cell count. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated worsened bilateral infiltrates. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and transferred to the intensive care unit. However, he rapidly experienced further respiratory decompensation requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, as well as hemodynamic compromise requiring vasopressor support. Later that day, his blood and sputum cultures grew Escherichia coli. Over the next 4 days, he developed progressive organ dysfunction and died.

================================================================================

Title: Point-of-care Mixup: 1 Shot Turns Into 3

The Case:
A 2-month-old boy was brought in for a routine 2-month well-child visit. The exam was completed and the appropriate vaccinations were ordered, including Pentacel (which contains vaccines against DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis], Hib [Haemophilis influenza], IPV [inactivated polio vaccine]), Hep B (hepatitis B), PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), and RV (rotavirus). The nurse gave the vaccinations to the infant, and then, when documenting them in the electronic health record, noticed she had given the DTaP vaccination, not the Pentacel combination. The patient and his mother were still in the exam room; the mother was breastfeeding the infant.

The physician spoke with the mother about the error. The mother was distressed to learn that her son would need two additional injections but agreed for them to be given because she knew her child needed the additional vaccinations (Hib and IPV). The patient cried and was difficult to settle after the additional injections. In the postincident review, the nurse described being rushed and because of that, she did not properly verify the vaccinations against the orders before administering them.

================================================================================

Title: Add-on Case and the Missing Checklist

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of abdominal pain and weight loss. Based on diagnostic data and imaging, she was found to have a large gastric mass concerning for malignancy. The patient had recently been diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis, which was being treated with enoxaparin (an anticoagulant). A gastroenterologist was consulted for possible biopsy of the gastric mass. The gastroenterologist planned to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy the following day. This recommendation was not conveyed directly to the hospitalist caring for the patient, although the consultant did document it in his note.

The next day, the patient was scheduled for an EGD as an add-on case. Because the hospitalist was unaware of the plan, the patient was not made NPO (nothing by mouth), nor was the enoxaparin stopped. When the endoscopy suite called for the patient, the bedside nurse said that the patient had just had breakfast, but she forgot to mention that morning dose of the anticoagulant had already been given. Three hours later, the patient was taken to the EGD suite. While performing the preanesthesia checklist, the certified nurse anesthetist documented that enoxaparin had been given that morning, but did not notify the gastroenterologist. EGD was performed and a biopsy was taken from the mass. The patient was observed briefly in the recovery room and sent back to her room on the ward.

Two hours later, the patient developed delirium and looked pale. She was found to be hypotensive and stat labs were sent. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids was started, but within 15 minutes, the patient went into cardiac arrest. The laboratory results showed a sharp drop in her blood count, consistent with postprocedural bleeding. The patient was resuscitated, transferred to the intensive care unit, and received massive transfusions. An angiogram revealed that the bleeding was from the gastric mass. Embolization was attempted but was unsuccessful, and the patient subsequently arrested again. After extensive discussions with the family, the decision was made to focus on comfort measures only. The patient died shortly thereafter.

================================================================================

Title: The Hidden Harms of Hand Sanitizer

The Case:
A 57-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and severe depression was admitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. After 2 days on the medical ward, she was found unconscious. Oxygen was administered, and the patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator. As part of the workup for her altered mental status, a toxicology panel was drawn, and her blood alcohol level returned elevated at 530 mg/dL. A search of the ward revealed several empty containers of alcoholic foam hand sanitizer. The patient required mechanical ventilatory support for over 12 hours, after which she was successfully extubated. Upon interview, the patient confessed to ingesting the alcoholic foam hand sanitizer on the ward to satisfy her strong alcohol craving.

================================================================================

Title: Delayed Recognition of a Positive Blood Culture

The Case:
A 58-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer recently treated with immunosuppressive therapy presented to the hospital for evaluation of diarrhea. As part of the infectious workup performed in the emergency department (ED), blood cultures and stool studies were sent to the laboratory. The following morning, her stool test returned positive forClostridium difficile(C. difficile), a potent bacteria that can cause serious infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts. At that time, one out of the two blood cultures drawn in the ED was positive for gram-positive rods, but the speciation (type of bacteria) and sensitivity profile (which suggests which antibiotics are best to use) were not yet available. The medical team ordered appropriate antibiotic treatment forC. difficilebut did not initiate treatment for the preliminarily positive blood culture.

After improvement in her symptoms, the patient was discharged 2 days after admission with instructions to complete the course of antibiotics forC. difficileand to follow up with her outpatient providers. On the day of discharge, the blood culture that was positive for gram-positive rods had now speciated and was growingListeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause life-threatening infection if not treated appropriately. Moreover, a diagnosis ofListeria monocytogenesmust be reported to the local department of public health because of its risk of contagion. Unaware that the patient required treatment for listeriosis, the team discharged her.

A later review revealed that the hospital microbiology laboratory was aware of the microbiology result and, per its protocol, had notified the patient's bedside nurse of the positive blood culture. However, this result was not communicated to the primary medical team prior to the patient's discharge. Some team members who saw the positive result in the medical record erroneously thought thatListeria monocytogenesmight be a contaminant (a bacteria that can be viewed as a false positive not requiring treatment). Although the positive blood culture was sent to the medical attending's inbox in the electronic health record, he did not see the result until well after the patient was discharged. When the mistake was recognized, the team called the patient and she was immediately readmitted to the medical service. The positive blood culture was reported to the city's department of public health. She received further workup including additional blood cultures and a lumbar puncture, which remained negative. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated for treatment of listeriosis. She was eventually discharged and did well.

================================================================================

Title: Diagnostic Overshadowing Dangers

The Case:
A 72-year-old woman with history of opioid abuse was sent to the emergency department (ED) from a methadone clinic because she appeared confused when she came to get her daily dose of methadone. In the ED, the patient complained of pain in her epigastric region and back. She was given IV fluids for tachycardia (heart rate 140 beats per minute [bpm]) and hypotension, with prompt improvement in her blood pressure but not in tachycardia. The initial electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 156 bpm and initial laboratory test results revealed a white blood cell count of 19,000/μL, troponins at 0.38 μg/L, and creatine kinase of 270 U/L. A CT scan of her abdomen revealed multiple fractures at thoracic and lumbar spinal region with possible cord compression.

Neurosurgery was consulted and the attending requested an MRI to further evaluate the spinal cord. The patient was given pain medication but remained tachycardic. The MRI, performed about 13 hours after admission, revealed an acute L2 fracture with cord compression. Neurosurgery recommended conservative management until morning. The patient was admitted to the ward, still tachycardic and complaining of pain in the epigastric region. The medical team attributed her pain to the fracture.

The next morning, the patient's troponin levels were in the 20s μg/L and creatine kinase was approximately 900 U/L. However, because of a delay in reporting, by the time the medical team saw the laboratory test results, it was 28 hours into the admission. A stat electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation in the inferior leads, diagnostic of a myocardial infarction. A "Code STEMI" (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) was called, but the clinicians chose to delay taking the patient to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, since they wanted the use of any antiplatelet agents to be cleared by neurosurgery in light of her spinal fracture. A bedside echocardiogram revealed severely reduced left ventricular function with an akinetic inferior wall and an ejection fraction of about 10%.

The patient was eventually stabilized on cardiac medications. At the time of discharge, it was unclear how much of her cardiac function might recover. As the team reflected on the case, they believed that they had not responded aggressively enough to the patient's epigastric pain because of her history of drug use and chronic pain.

================================================================================

Title: Chest Tube Complications

The Case:
A 30-year-old woman with a history of cystic fibrosis was admitted to the hospital for management of a spontaneous left pneumothorax (collapse of her lung). She required urgent thoracostomy (chest tube) placement in the emergency department. The chest tube was connected to wall suction in order to promote reexpansion of her lung.

Over the next 2 days, the patient improved, and repeat imaging showed reexpansion of her lung. The consulting pulmonary team felt that the chest tube might be able to be removed, so they requested that the tube be disconnected from suction and clamped. The plan was to obtain a chest radiograph 1 hour after clamping the tube, and if the pneumothorax had not recurred, the tube would be removed.

About 45 minutes after the tube was clamped, the patient complained of acute, sharp pain radiating to her left arm. The nurse gave the patient pain medication. She noted that the radiograph had not yet been done but assumed that it would be done soon. Unfortunately, the radiograph was not done, and the nurse became busy with another acutely deteriorating patient.

Approximately 2 hours later (3 hours after the tube was clamped), the nurse found the patient unresponsive, in cardiac arrest with a rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. A code blue was called. The code team recognized that the arrest could have been due to a tension pneumothorax, reconnected the chest tube to suction, and eventually performed needle decompression. Despite these measures, the patient did not recover spontaneous circulation for more than 30 minutes and sustained severe anoxic brain injury as a result. The patient required tracheostomy and feeding tube placement, and she was eventually transferred to a long-term care facility with a poor neurologic prognosis.

The hospital conducted a root cause analysis (RCA). The RCA committee found that there was considerable variation around chest tube removal practices between services. For example, the trauma surgery service did not routinely perform a clamping trial before chest tube removal. Although other services did perform such a trial, there was variation in when the radiograph was performed after clamping the tube. The committee noted that this variation led to confusion among bedside nurses about how to monitor patients and communicate with physicians immediately after chest tube removal. As a result, the committee felt the complication might still have occurred even if the radiograph had been performed.

================================================================================

Title: Communication Error in a Closed ICU

The Case:
A 70-year-old man with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (status post kidney transplant), coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease requiring lower extremity bypass surgery in the past, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock secondary to an infected lower extremity wound. Soon after admission, he developed hypotension refractory to intravenous fluid resuscitation. The ICU team decided that the patient required central venous catheter placement in order to administer vasopressors to improve his blood pressure.

The ICU at this hospital was a closed system, where the ICU team had primary responsibility for daily management and acute issues, including performing procedures. The surgical team rounded on patients daily and discussed the plan of care with the ICU team regularly, but the team was not first call and did not write routine orders. The ICU team thus decided to place the central line after confirming the plan with the surgical team. Establishing central venous access in this patient was challenging. He had been on hemodialysis in the past through a right upper extremity arteriovenous fistula, which had failed. Due to worsening function of his transplanted kidney and anticipated need for restarting hemodialysis, he had a catheter in his left internal jugular vein already. The combination of this catheter and his prior fistula meant that upper extremity catheter placement was not possible. The ICU team therefore chose to place the central line in the right femoral vein and was able to do so after much effort. However, the team failed to recognize that the patient's transplanted kidney was also on the right side. This was a serious mistake, as femoral catheter placement is contraindicated on the same side as a transplanted kidney due to the risk of damaging the vein to which the transplanted kidney is anastomosed (surgically attached).

As the ICU team was finishing the procedure, the transplant surgeon arrived and recognized the mistake. The surgeon was furious at the ICU team for making such an error. Attempts were made to cannulate the left femoral vein, but they were unsuccessful due to the presence of blood clots. The patient required vasopressor administration through the right femoral line for several hours despite the risks, as he remained hemodynamically unstable. Eventually, the left internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a different catheter that could be used for vasopressor administration.

Over the next few days, the patient's kidney function continued to worsen and hemodialysis was initiated. The relationship between the ICU team and the surgical team remained tense and mistrustful, and the intensivists eventually ceded primary responsibility for the patient to the surgeons. The patient's overall condition did not respond to aggressive therapy for septic shock, and he eventually developed multiple organ system failure. After extensive discussion, his family eventually decided to pursue comfort measures only, and he died on hospital day 12.

================================================================================

Title: Hemolysis Holdup

The Case:
A 72-year-old man with congestive heart failure due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department (ED) with new onset generalized weakness. The ED physician ordered a chemistry panel, which came back as showing evidence of acute kidney injury, as well as a serum potassium level of 7.4 mEq/L (normal range 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L). However, the laboratory noted that the patient's blood sample was hemolyzed, which can spuriously increase the measured serum potassium.

The ED physician assumed that the first result must have been incorrect due to hemolysis, but felt that the patient should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment of his acute kidney injury. She ordered a repeat potassium level and called the hospitalist for admission. The hospitalist noted mild electrocardiographic abnormalities that could have been consistent with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), but she did not institute immediate treatment for hyperkalemia as the repeat level was still pending. The patient was admitted to the medical ward.

When the patient arrived at the floor, he started to feel more confused and lethargic and he became progressively more hypotensive and bradycardic. The laboratory then called the hospitalist with a panic result—the repeat potassium level had come back at 8.4 mEq/L, a level associated with a high risk of cardiac complications. Almost immediately thereafter, the patient went into cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and emergently administered calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin to treat the hyperkalemia. He was able to be resuscitated and was emergently transferred to the intensive care unit for initiation of hemodialysis. The patient had a lengthy hospital course, but he ultimately survived and was discharged home off dialysis and with improved renal function.

================================================================================

Title: Wrong-side Bedside Paravertebral Block: Preventing the Preventable

The Case:
An 84-year-old woman presented to the emergency department following a mechanical fall at home. The fall occurred as she attempted to sit down in the bathroom and missed the toilet, falling backwards and striking her right back and flank against the bathtub. Imaging demonstrated multiple right-sided rib fractures.

The patient was admitted to the medical-surgical ward. On the first hospital day, the patient continued to have difficulty with maximal inspiration because of pain associated with the rib fractures. The clinical team decided to obtain an anesthesia consultation to place a paravertebral block. The anesthesiologist performed the block on the patient while she was in her bed. At the completion of the block, postprocedure imaging was performed to rule out complications. It was then that the performing physician realized that the fractures were on the opposite side—which meant that the block had been placed on the wrong side. This was then confirmed by reviewing the chart.

On review of the case, it was noted that the personnel carrying out the procedure at the bedside had not performed the usual safety checks or a "time out" to identify the correct side.

The patient required an additional paravertebral block on the correct (right) side to control the pain, increasing her chances of postprocedure complications, including bleeding and pneumothorax. Because of the error, the patient was exposed to unnecessary additional medication, and the institution bore unnecessary additional costs for the additional local anesthesia, regional block instrument tray, and personnel (the patient was not charged for the repeat procedure).

================================================================================

Title: Patient Allergies and Electronic Health Records

The Case:
A 40-year-old woman presented with recurring intense right upper quadrant pain, which worsened with large meals. Her past medical history was significant for cholecystectomy 3 years earlier and gastroesophageal reflux disease controlled by proton-pump inhibitors. After she was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, an abdominal CT scan with contrast was ordered.

Upon the patient's arrival at the CT scan, a technician reviewed the electronic health record (EHR) for allergies and found none documented. The technician asked the patient whether she had ever responded poorly to contrast media or dyes. In response, the patient stated she had experienced hives upon receiving contrast in the past. Consequently, the patient was premedicated prior to receipt of the contrast agent, and diagnostic imaging was completed without further incident.

During a follow-up clinic visit, the patient discussed this contrast intolerance with a medical assistant, assuming the allergy had been documented in her medical record. Surprisingly, the intolerance was not listed. A follow-up investigation revealed that the previously stated intolerance had been removed from the patient's allergy profile and never updated at the clinic appointment. The investigation found that the medical assistant had removed contrast from the patient's allergy list because it was not a "true" allergy. She intended to ask where to document an intolerance in the EHR but forgot to ask. Consequently, the EHR had no evidence of either allergy or intolerance to contrast. This case led to a system-wide analysis of practices regarding allergy documentation in the EHR and development of a mechanism to prevent a similar event in the future.

Title: Correct Treatment Plan for Incorrect Diagnosis: A Pharmacist Intervention

The Case:
A 48-year-old woman with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection, migraines, polysubstance abuse, and a penicillin allergy presented to the emergency department with complaints of headache and blurry vision. Meningitis was ruled out by a negative lumbar puncture; neurosyphilis was ruled out by a negative cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Additional blood tests were sent out to test for other infectious causes of her symptoms, and the patient was discharged home. Following her discharge, the results of a full infectious disease panel returned showing a nonreactive rapid plasma reagin but positive FTA-ABS, a potential indication of latent syphilis. The patient was asked to return to the infectious disease clinic for follow-up.

At the follow-up appointment, the infectious disease attending recommended standard treatment: penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses. Because of her allergy history, the patient was first sent to the hospital for penicillin sensitivity testing. The plan was to initiate the penicillin desensitization protocol if she had an allergic reaction to initial testing, or to give her the first dose of penicillin and have her report to the Department of Public Health for the remaining doses if she did not.

The penicillin sensitivity test result was negative, so the allergist placed orders to initiate penicillin therapy. Recalling the patient's previous symptoms of headache and blurry vision, the allergist placed orders for neurosyphilis treatment (a far higher penicillin dose, and an inappropriate one since neurosyphilis had been ruled out). These orders included hospital admission, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placement, and penicillin G 4 million units every 4 hours via the PICC line.

On seeing the admission diagnosis of neurosyphilis, the pharmacist verifying the patient's admission orders performed a thorough chart review. The pharmacist realized that neurosyphilis had been ruled out and contacted the allergist to clarify the treatment plan. The allergist recognized the error, and the orders were corrected to reflect treatment for latent syphilis. The patient received her first IM dose of penicillin G benzathine and was referred to receive her two additional doses of penicillin. The pharmacist's catch prevented an unnecessary hospital admission, a PICC line, and multiple doses of IV penicillin.

Title: Diagnosing a Missed Diagnosis

The Case:
A 57-year old woman was admitted to the hospital with cough, slurred speech, confusion, and disorientation. She was taking modified-release lithium for bipolar disorder. Her medical history was also significant for primary hyperparathyroidism and coronary artery disease. A brain CT on admission showed no evidence of a stroke or intracranial bleed. Her initial serum sodium level was normal at 140 mmol/L, but her serum calcium level was mildly elevated. Her initial serum lithium level was also mildly elevated at 1.5 mmol/L.

The patient's delirium was attributed to hypercalcemia, so she was admitted to the ward and hydrated with intravenous (IV) normal saline. Her lithium was continued. The following day, she remained confused and disoriented. Her hypercalcemia had slightly improved, but her serum sodium had risen to 149 mmol/L. The bedside nurse told the physician that the patient seemed to be going to the bathroom frequently; urine output had not been formally recorded. The physician attributed the rising sodium to the IV fluids and decided to continue aggressive hydration given the lack of improvement in her symptoms. A repeat lithium level was not ordered.

That evening, the nurse found the patient to be comatose and minimally responsive. The patient was urgently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where repeat labs showed a sodium level of 163 mmol/L (normal < 145 mmol/L). She required intubation for airway protection, and a repeat lithium level was markedly elevated at 2.1 mmol/L. After admission to the ICU, her urine output was noted to be 500 cc/hour of extremely dilute urine, consistent with a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to lithium toxicity.

The patient was successfully managed in the ICU with 5% dextrose infusion to gradually correct her hypernatremia. Her lithium was held, and she was treated with ibuprofen and diuretics. Her mental status gradually improved and she was able to be extubated on hospital day 3. Fortunately, she did not experience any neurologic sequelae, and she was discharged home on hospital day 7. Her lithium was discontinued and she was started on valproic acid for treatment of her bipolar disorder.

Title: Refused Medication Error

The Case:
A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure and mental status changes. He was alert to self and place only. The patient had end-stage liver disease and was not following his home treatment regimen. Specifically, he was noted to have doubled his daily dose of furosemide for more than 5 days in an attempt to remove edema. He was also noted to be poorly adherent with his lactulose.

Initial therapy was to carefully correct his acute renal injury while using lactulose to improve his hepatic encephalopathy. With treatment, both his mental status and his creatinine improved. Throughout his admission, he was assessed as a very high fall risk on a standard risk scale. As his platelet level was less than 40,000 ?l, the staff's level of concern was heightened, in that a fall could be associated with dangerous bleeding.

As his hospitalization progressed, the patient refused to take his lactulose because of frustration with frequent, loose stools. The nursing staff noted the patient refusal in his medication record, but did not inform his primary care team. On the fourth day after his initial refusal, the patient became more confused, now only oriented to self, and began acting impulsively, including getting out of bed without assistance. The nurse alerted the primary care team of the patient's declining mental status and their concern about increased fall risk, but did not describe the missed doses of lactulose. The patient was placed on close observation for safety purposes but continued to decline and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

After being transferred to the ICU, the patient's mental status further deteriorated, and he became comatose and required intubation. The following morning, his next-of-kin and health care surrogate provided documentation of the patient's wish to forego mechanical ventilation. Less than 24 hours after admission to the ICU, the patient was extubated and died shortly thereafter.

Title: Safeguarding Diagnostic Testing at the Point of Care

The Case:
A 23-year-old woman presented to the family medicine clinic for contraception. She was sexually active with one partner and expressed interest in long-term contraception. After talking with her provider, she selected intrauterine device (IUD) placement.

The protocol in the clinic was to check a urine pregnancy test prior to placing an IUD. The patient provided a urine sample to the nurse. Point-of-care testing in the office revealed a negative result. The physician informed the patient and then placed the IUD during the same visit without complication.

At the end of her shift, the nurse manually entered the results of all point-of-care tests performed in the office that day into the appropriate patient's electronic medical record. By mistake, she entered the result of the urine pregnancy test for this patient as positive instead of negative. When the patient's provider received the positive result via electronic notification, she recognized the error and immediately corrected the medical record.

Although the mistake was recognized quickly and no incorrect information was relayed to the patient, the provider decided to review the results of all point-of-care tests that had been manually entered into the electronic health record system for her patients that day to make sure there were no other errors.

Title: A Potent Medication Administered in a Not So Viable Route

The Case:
A 55-year-old man with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe systolic dysfunction, as well as diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease, was brought to the emergency department for septic shock of possible intra-abdominal origin. Owing to his cardiac condition, he was given a minimal fluid challenge and vasopressor support was ordered.

The plan was to start norepinephrine bitartrate after the placement of a central intravenous line. However, for reasons that are unclear, the norepinephrine was infused through a peripheral line. It was started at a low dose but then titrated up to 20 μg/hr to address the patient's continued hypotension. Approximately 7 hours later, when the intensive care unit team arrived to transfer the patient to the critical care unit, they were surprised to not find any central line. Instead, they found the norepinephrine was infusing in the peripheral line placed near the patient's right wrist.

The patient now complained of severe pain. However, given his altered mental status in the setting of sepsis, he could not point out where he felt the pain. His right arm, and particularly the fingers, had a bluish discoloration. The team recognized that the vasopressor had extravasated into the subcutaneous tissue of the arm. A right internal jugular line was immediately placed, and the norepinephrine switched to infuse through this central line. Attempts were made to treat the extravasation and salvage the right wrist and fingers, but eventually three of the patient's fingertips had to be amputated. The patient eventually recovered from his sepsis and was discharged home.

The case was discussed in the multi-departmental morbidity and mortality review, and a new protocol was issued that potent medications may be started only after the pharmacy, primary medical team, and nurses identify the medication, route of administration, and plan for titration. The protocol also stated that vasopressors may only be infused through central lines.

Title: Hazards of Loading Doses

The Case:
A 40-year-old woman was recently discharged after a prolonged hospitalization for seizures and a cardiac arrest. Two days after discharge, she presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Her stool tested positive forClostridium difficilecolitis, which led to admission to the medicine service. As part of the initial ED patient evaluation, the neurology fellow (seeing the patient because of her history of seizures) noted a subtherapeutic phenytoin serum level and subsequently recommended that she be re-loaded with phenytoin. The ED physician ordered the correct loading dose of intravenous (IV) phenytoin, to be administered every 8 hours for 3 doses. Unfortunately, the physician failed to order that the dose be switched back to the appropriate maintenance dose of once daily after the loading was completed, so the patient continued to receive IV phenytoin every 8 hours.

Three days after admission, the patient developed somnolence, severe ataxia, and dysarthria. These new symptoms prompted the medicine provider to evaluate the patient's hospital course and medication history. After noticing the phenytoin dosing at every 8 hours, he checked a serum phenytoin level, which returned at 3 times greater than the maximum therapeutic level. The patient's neurologic symptoms persisted for 3 days after discontinuation of phenytoin. However, no long-term harm occurred.

Investigation of the event revealed that the admitting medicine physician did notice the unusually high phenytoin dose; however, he did not question it because he assumed it was recommended by the neurology service. Apparently, the neurology consultant told the ED physician about his recommendations, but no formal consult note had been placed in the patient's chart to provide clear instructions for phenytoin dosing or monitoring.

Title: The Empty Bag

The Case:
A 90-year-old woman with end-stage dementia was admitted to an acute care hospital for treatment of a hip fracture after a fall at a nursing home. During the hospitalization, her kidney function worsened, as did her mental status. Because of this, the patient's family chose not to put her through surgery, and she was placed on the hospice service for comfort care.

The care team identified that the patient had increasing restlessness and that the current order for intravenous (IV) push morphine PRN [when necessary] was not effective for pain control. The physician ordered a morphine drip for better pain control. The nurse set up the morphine drip along with a carrier solution of normal saline. He placed the normal saline on a pump but failed to place the morphine drip on a pump as well. He mistakenly set the rate intended for the morphine on the pump that the normal saline was on, and opened the clamps for both solutions. He turned the pump on and left the room to answer an alarm for another patient. The nurse had five other patients assigned to him that day.

The nurse checked on the patient approximately every 30 minutes, but only observed from the doorway and asked the family members present how things were going. Approximately 4 hours after the nurse started the morphine drip, he noticed that the patient was breathing very slowly and went to the bedside to examine her. He noted that the patient appeared near death and explained this to the family. Realizing that the morphine bag was empty, he immediately called the physician, obtained an order for naloxone, and administered it to the patient. However, the patient died shortly thereafter.

Later, the bedside nurse and the charge nurse went back into the room to examine the IV set-up and pump. They discovered that the morphine was connected into the tubing below the pump for the saline (instead of in its own pump), which meant it had flowed into the patient at an uncontrolled rate.

================================================================================

Title: One Dose, Two Errors

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis and respiratory failure secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient was intubated and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while waiting for blood culture results. A few hours into the admission, the microbiology lab called the ICU to report that the blood cultures were growing yeast. The report was received by the nurse and relayed to the covering resident. The patient was immediately started on treatment with intravenous (IV) amphotericin (an antifungal drug), and broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued.

Two days later, the patient's respiratory status was improving and she was extubated. However, she was noted to have worsening renal function and decreased urine output, and she needed to be placed on hemodialysis on hospital day 3. The consulting nephrologist felt that amphotericin toxicity was the most likely cause of the acute kidney injury. A new resident took over the patient's care that day, after the previous resident rotated off service. She reviewed the laboratory data and was surprised to find that the patient had no positive blood cultures reported in the electronic medical record. She called the microbiology lab, who confirmed that the patient had not had any positive blood cultures. In the course of the discussion, she came to a troubling realization: the positive yeast cultures were actually for the patient in theadjacentICU bed.

Further review revealed that the information about the positive yeast culture had been correctly called in to the bedside nurse, who then relayed to the correct resident. However, the resident had been caring for both patients, and he mistakenly entered the amphotericin order for the wrong patient.

At this hospital, prescribing IV amphotericin required approval from an infectious disease specialist due to its potential for toxicity. The resident who placed the order had, in fact, called the infectious disease fellow, described the correct patient, and obtained approval for the medication. However, once the verbal approval was secured, no further verification was required—the resident merely had to enter "infectious disease approval obtained" into the free-text section of the electronic order for amphotericin.

Once the error was detected, the amphotericin was immediately stopped. The patient who had received the drug continued to require hemodialysis for several more days. Although she was not dialysis-dependent when discharged from the hospital, her kidney function never returned to her previous baseline. The other patient—who should have been started on amphotericin—did not experience any adverse consequences as a result of the delay in initiating appropriate therapy.

Title: Continuity Errors in Resident Clinic

The Case:
A 32-year-old woman presented to internal medicine clinic for evaluation of headaches and difficulty concentrating. The symptoms began after a motor vehicle collision a week earlier. She tried to schedule the visit with her primary care doctor—a resident—but his available slots were already full. This was not unusual—his availability was often limited to one clinic session per week due to his inpatient clinical obligations. Therefore, the appointment was booked with another resident provider.

During the clinic visit, the patient relayed the events of the collision to the resident. She reported that she had been sitting in the backseat, wearing her seatbelt, and that the impact caused her to strike her head on the window. Immediately after, she had been taken to a local emergency department for evaluation. Physical examination and head imaging were unremarkable, and the patient was discharged home. She subsequently developed headaches and difficulty concentrating as well as sensitivity to sound and light. The resident diagnosed probable postconcussive syndrome and started the patient on amitriptyline.

Given a lack of improvement in her symptoms, the patient returned to the same clinic 4 days later. Again, her primary provider was not available to see her. The resident who had seen her initially was no longer on his outpatient rotation, and the appointment was booked with a different resident provider. This resident ordered a brain MRI and placed a referral for the patient to be seen in neurology clinic. The resident had never placed a subspecialty referral before and did not realize that there were multiple neurology clinics. When the patient arrived at the neurology appointment several days later, she was informed that the referral had been made to the neuromuscular clinic though it should have been made to the headache clinic.

The patient returned to the internal medicine clinic for a third time because she was still experiencing severe headaches. This time she was able to see her assigned primary care provider. Although she was frustrated by the lack of continuity and incorrect neurology referral, the patient repeated in detail the same history she had relayed to the first and second resident providers. Her primary provider increased the dose of her amitriptyline and placed a new neurology referral to the headache clinic. The patient's headaches improved, and she was feeling much better by the time she saw the neurologist.
