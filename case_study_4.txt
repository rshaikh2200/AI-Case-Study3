Title: More Treatment—Better Care?

The Case:
The patient is a 27-year-old female who presented to a 250-bed community hospital with numbness and tingling of her hands and feet. She was promptly evaluated by a neurologist and diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Once the diagnosis was established, she was started on plasmapheresis using a Quinton catheter placed by interventional radiology. She received six treatments over 12 days, then another two treatments a week later. The patient's indwelling catheter remained in for the entire course of therapy. Toward the end of the 3rd week of treatment, she developed a fever of 101 degrees and an elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Vancomycin was started empirically and the Quinton catheter removed for a presumed line infection. After 48 hours, she was afebrile, and her WBC returned to normal. Blood cultures were negative.

At the time that the diagnosis was made, the Medical Director of Case Management contacted the neurologist to provide him with the 2010 evidence-based guidelines on the use of plasmapheresis in Guillain-Barré syndrome published by the American Society of Apheresis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20568098). This guideline recommends five to six treatments over 10–14 days, with data indicating that additional treatments are only indicated for relapse. The Medical Director reviewed the risks of plasmapheresis with the physician and asked him to follow the recommended treatment course rather than treating the patient as he had treated the previous Guillain-Barré syndrome patient, who had received 20 treatments over 40 days. At that time, when the neurologist and nephrologist who ordered this were asked why so many treatments were given, they both responded that the patient was improving so they felt that more treatments would help him recover even more.

Title: Order Interrupted by Text: Multitasking Mishap

The Case:
A 56-year-old man with dementia was admitted to an academic medical center from a nursing home for replacement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, which had become dislodged and was no longer functioning. The patient had a distant history of an intracardiac mural thrombus and was on long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. At the time of admission, his international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.4 (the INR is a measure of anticoagulation intensity in patients treated with warfarin). Since the goal INR was 2.0–3.0, he was not adequately anticoagulated and was at risk for stroke from the cardiac thrombus.

He underwent successful PEG tube replacement on hospital day one. Later that day, the resident on the team decided to prescribe warfarin 10 mg per day (an increase over his usual dose of 5 mg/day) for 3 days to try to increase his INR into the target range.

On hospital day two, when the resident and intern were rounding with the attending, they discussed the plan for ongoing anticoagulation. As the patient had been on warfarin for many years, the attending wanted to confirm that the intracardiac thrombus was still present to justify ongoing anticoagulation. The attending stated clearly to the resident that they should stop the warfarin until they could obtain an echocardiogram of the heart.

This academic medical center had a robust computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system that allowed providers to enter orders using handheld devices and smartphones. While the team was rounding with the attending, the resident was able to enter orders in real time as team members evaluated patients.

When the attending stated they should stop the anticoagulation for this patient, the resident began to enter the order into her smartphone. As she was entering the order, the resident received a text message from a friend regarding an upcoming party, and she confirmed her attendance through text messaging. The team moved on to the next problem.

The resident never completed the order to discontinue the warfarin, and the patient continued to receive 10 mg each day for the next 3 days. Because everyone on the team thought the medication had been stopped, no one checked the patient's INR. In addition, because of the robust CPOE system, neither the intern nor resident reviewed the medication list for the next few days so no one recognized that the patient was still receiving the warfarin.

On hospital day four, the patient developed shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypotension (low blood pressure). An echocardiogram revealed hemopericardium (blood filling the sack around the heart) with evidence of tamponade (pressure from the blood limiting his heart function). He required emergency open heart surgery (pericardiocentesis and pericardial window) to remove the blood. His INR was 8.5 at the time, indicating he was overanticoagulated—his blood was too thin. The team felt he had suffered spontaneous bleeding into the pericardium from receiving the extra doses of warfarin.

The patient survived the operation and ultimately was discharged back to the nursing home after a 3-week hospital stay.

Title: Liver Failure After Chemotherapy: Did We Forget Something?

The Case:
A 51-year-old Cantonese-speaking female with a history of stage 3 breast cancer had been receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Of note, the oncology service had checked her liver function tests prior to chemotherapy, and they were found to be normal. Hepatitis serologies were not checked prior to administration of chemotherapy. Well into receipt of her chemotherapy, the patient complained of fever, rash, and bone pain and was subsequently admitted to the general medicine service. Admitting labs were notable for a mild transaminitis, but repeat testing of liver function tests was not performed during this hospitalization nor were hepatitis serologies checked. Cultures of blood and urine were negative, and her symptoms were attributed to pegfilgrastim (fever, bone pain) and paclitaxel (rash). Two days later, the patient presented with abdominal pain and AST of 9986 U/L, ALT 4366 U/L, and an INR of 2.3. Shortly thereafter, she became encephalopathic, requiring endotracheal intubation. Subsequent review of her outside records revealed chronic hepatitis B, diagnosed 15 years earlier, with surface antigen positivity. The patient had no knowledge of her hepatitis B diagnosis. The patient was started on entecavir for her reactivation of hepatitis B and transferred to a liver transplant center. Luckily, she has made a complete recovery from her liver failure and is receiving chronic therapy for her hepatitis B, along with treatment for her breast cancer.

Analysis of the case revealed that the oncology department lacked a standard practice to check hepatitis serologies on patients prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Moreover, the admitting team erred by not considering the possibility of hepatitis as the cause of the patient's fever, rash, and transaminitis.

================================================================================

Title: Near Miss with Bedside Medications

The Case:
A 77-year-old man on anticoagulation for a history of recent deep venous thrombosis presented to the emergency department (ED) with dizziness. In the ED, he had a heart rate of 44 beats per minute, which was felt to explain his symptoms. On further history, he revealed that he had recently increased his beta-blocker, a blood pressure medication that slows the heart.

The ED physician was concerned about the prospect of his heart rate slowing further. She ordered a syringe of atropine be placed at the bedside so it could be injected urgently if he needed it (atropine is a powerful anti-cholinergic medication that is given in emergent situations to raise the heart rate; it can cause rapid heart rate and severe confusion if used inappropriately).

Fortunately, the patient's heart rate improved while he was in the ED, and the plan was to discharge him home on a lower dose of his beta-blocker. Of note, his level of anticoagulation (i.e., his international normalized ratio [INR]) on warfarin (oral blood thinner) was found to be low. So, along with decreasing his beta-blocker dose, the plan included having him inject himself with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at home for a few days to ensure adequate anticoagulation while waiting for his INR to rise into the target range.

The pharmacist came to the ED to teach the patient how to do the subcutaneous LMWH injections, which would be required twice a day. The patient seemed to have some difficulty in understanding the medications, but the pharmacist felt comfortable with the plan to discharge him to home. She gave him 10 syringes pre-filled with the appropriate dose of LMWH to take home until he could be seen in the anticoagulation clinic.

When the patient was packing up everything from the ED, he took not only the boxes of LMWH, but also the box with the syringe of atropine that was still sitting by his bedside.

At home the next day, he tried to inject himself with the atropine but the liquid squirted all over his stomach (the atropine syringe does not have a needle as it is usually injected directly into a peripheral IV). Confused, he called the pharmacist. When the pharmacist had him spell the name on the box, she realized what had happened and had him discard the atropine. Fortunately, the patient was not harmed.

================================================================================

Title: The Case for Patient Flow Management

The Case:
A 52-year-old woman with a history of major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol abuse was hospitalized for suicidality in March. After several weeks of inpatient treatment, the patient stabilized and was discharged back to her (outpatient) psychiatrist, a resident in the final year of training and due to graduate at the end of June. The patient saw this physician multiple times during April, May, and early June. At her last visit before the academic year-end transfer, the patient was not given a follow-up appointment because the clinic schedules for incoming residents, who would begin on July 1st, were neither finalized nor operational in the electronic scheduling system. Per existing protocol, the patient was asked to contact the clinic in July to set up an appointment with her new psychiatrist.

The patient did not call to schedule an appointment and was not prompted to do so. The incoming resident psychiatrist recognized this a month after starting (the resident had been given a brief sign-out by the outgoing resident that included this patient's tenuous condition) and contacted the patient to set up an initial visit. Because the resident's schedule was already booked through August, the patient was not seen until early September, at which point the patient stated that she felt better. She set up another appointment for later that month and told the resident that her primary care provider had given her sufficient medication refills.

Unfortunately, the patient did not make her second scheduled appointment. The patient's daughter notified the resident that the patient had died after driving her car into a tree. Autopsy results indicated alcohol and drug intoxication. While there was no way to be certain, a review of the case by the involved clinicians raised the possibility that the patient's 3-month hiatus (from last appointment with the outgoing resident in early June until the appointment with her new physician in early September) may have contributed to her demise.

================================================================================

Title: Communication Failure—Who's in Charge?

The Case:
A 20-month-old boy was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) following a Fontan surgical procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The child initially made good progress. He was weaned from inotropic support and tolerated enteral liquids on the first postoperative day. That evening the child developed respiratory distress with acidosis and fever. The resident physician notified the on-call ICU attending, who came in from home to manage the child's respiratory status. The surgeon called from home to check on the child at midnight and spoke with the resident, who indicated that the child had suffered respiratory deterioration and that the ICU attending was at the bedside managing the patient. The surgeon requested an echocardiogram but did not speak directly to the ICU attending, and the cardiology fellow who performed the echocardiogram communicated results to the surgeon, the child's attending of record for this admission.

After stabilizing and monitoring the child's respiratory status, the ICU attending returned home. The resident communicated with the ICU attending by phone and pager through the rest of the night, as the child's status was not improving as expected. The resident assumed the ICU attending was communicating with the surgeon, and did not contact the surgeon or cardiologist. The child suffered a cardiac arrest at 7:00 AM from low cardiac output. The surgeon and cardiologist arrived in the ICU for rounds just minutes before the arrest. Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts, the child suffered massive brain injury and subsequently died.

In post-event debriefings, staff identified several issues in the care of this patient. The attending surgeon and cardiologist were only briefed on the initial respiratory distress and did not have a complete picture of the child's condition; similarly, the ICU attending focused on stabilizing the child's respiratory status and missed his low cardiac output. There was confusion among the resident physicians and nursing staff about who was coordinating the child's care, and a lack of awareness of how to ensure effective team communication when multiple attending physicians are involved in caring for a child. The residents and nurses noted that having the ICU attending physician at the bedside left them with the impression that the surgeon and cardiologist were being updated about the child's continuing deterioration. The nurse observed the resident on the phone frequently discussing the case, and did not realize that no one was communicating with the other physicians involved. The resident and nurse either did not recognize the need to escalate the case beyond the ICU attending, or were not comfortable doing so. The surgeon and cardiologist were under the impression the child's issues were respiratory, not multi-system, and because of this, as well as the belief that the attending ICU physician was in-house throughout the night, neither of them recognized a need to go to the hospital to evaluate the child.

================================================================================

Title: The Dropped "No"

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis was admitted with increasing abdominal girth and swelling in his legs. Because the leg swelling was somewhat more pronounced in his right leg, the team ordered an ultrasound to rule out a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or blood clot. The ultrasound showed no DVT—this finding was communicated verbally to the primary team. However, on dictation, the first word "No" was obscured by the dictation system click that occurs when the speaker initiates recording. As a result, the truncated report read, "DVT is seen…" rather than "No DVT is seen…" Based on the verbal communication with the radiologist, the primary team proceeded under the (correct) understanding that the ultrasound had been negative.

Unfortunately, when the patient developed a heart arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) two nights later (a Saturday), the night float resident looked at the (incorrect) report. Believing that the patient had a DVT, the resident appropriately worried that part of the blood clot had broken off, travelled to the lung, and caused a pulmonary embolus. When the primary team returned in the morning, the night float alerted them to this read. The primary team's resident paged radiology and spoke with the on-call radiologist (a resident) who was at another site and, therefore, did not have access to the image. The on-call resident was able to pull up the report—which appeared to indicate that there was a DVT—and reassured the primary team that the original reader was one of the best.

Because the patient was a poor candidate for anticoagulation, a filter was placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC)—a major blood vessel that transports blood to the lung. Concerned that a read had changed (from the verbal sign-out the radiology attending had given the resident to the official read) without a call to the team, the attending on the primary team filed an incident report. When the radiologist was contacted about the incident report, she remembered the patient and that he did not have a DVT. She was able to listen to the dictation and hear the click that obscured the "No" at the beginning of the report. Once the mistake was discovered, the IVC filter was removed (about 2 days after it was placed). Fortunately, the patient tolerated the procedures well.

================================================================================

Title: Mobility Lost in the ICU

The Case:
A 56-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease was admitted to a trauma service after injuries suffered from an assault and battery. The patient's injuries included a left shoulder dislocation and a minimally displaced fracture of a thoracic vertebral body without any neurologic compromise. Shortly after admission, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing hypoxia, requiring mechanical ventilation. This led to a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay for respiratory failure from an ischemic cardiac event and aspiration pneumonia.

Following 6 weeks of hospitalization, the patient was significantly deconditioned despite slow and steady improvements overall. As he was transferred out of the ICU, the physical therapist (PT) was consulted to assist in the rehabilitation process. After reviewing the medical records, the PT noted the initial shoulder injury on admission. In addition to providing a general assessment, the PT expressed concern that the shoulder injury had now progressed to involve significant limitation in range of motion and function with associated pain. The PT felt this may have been preventable with earlier and aggressive physical therapy interventions while in the ICU.

================================================================================

Title: Central, not Epidural

The Case:
A 55-year-old man with lung cancer recently had the lower lobe of his left lung removed. Post-operatively, he was awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. He was, however, malnourished from his cancer and experiencing significant pain at the surgical site. He had a chest tube and a urinary catheter in place, but was breathing on his own. The patient's pain was well controlled with fentanyl and bupivacaine administered through an epidural catheter. He was receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and lipids through a central venous catheter inserted in his left jugular vein.

Nurse A, assigned to the patient, left the unit for her regularly scheduled break. Before leaving, she prepared a new bottle of lipids and left it at the bedside, as the current bottle would run out while she was off the floor. When the old bottle of lipids was empty, Nurse B, covering the patient during the primary nurse's break, inadvertently attached the new lipid bottle to the Y-site of the epidural tubing rather than the central venous line.

Upon her return, Nurse A noted that the new bottle of lipids was infusing but did not check the lines. Lipids infused into the epidural catheter for several hours. The problem was not discovered until the nurses on the next shift made rounds and checked the patient's tubing. Fortunately, the patient experienced no adverse effects from the infusion of lipids into his epidural space.

================================================================================

Title: Situational (Un)Awareness

The Case:
A 75-year-old man was admitted on a Tuesday evening with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver function tests, including a bilirubin of 10.3 mg/dL. His CT scan demonstrated clear signs of acute cholangitis (an infection in the biliary tree, in this case due to blockage by gall stones). An order for IV antibiotics every 6 hours was placed electronically at 8:00 PM, and arrangements were made for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the following day to relieve the obstruction. On Wednesday morning rounds, the attending physician learned that the patient had not yet received any doses of antibiotic.

Subsequent analysis of the delay found the following: When an order is entered in the computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, the computer assigns it a "next logical time for administration." In this case, the order placed at 8:00 PM on Tuesday was assigned a "next logical administration time" of Wednesday at 00:00. The pharmacist, uncomfortable with a 4-hour delay, manually overrode midnight and entered "9:00 PM," but the computer converted that to 9:00 PM on Wednesday, a change he did not notice. Nurses from two shifts—the night shift on Tuesday and the day shift on Wednesday—cared for this seriously ill patient, and none questioned why he wasn't receiving antibiotics or why the antibiotics were not scheduled to be given until 24 hours after admission.

================================================================================

Title: The Safety and Quality of Long Term Care

The Case:
A 64-year-old woman with a past medical history of morbid obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, recurrent urinary tract infections, and depression was a resident of a long-term care facility (a skilled nursing facility) due to multiple chronic illnesses. At baseline, she used a wheelchair for mobility and required some assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs).

During an unassisted transfer from her wheelchair to her bed she slipped and fell. She immediately complained of hip pain and was transferred to an acute care hospital. She was found to have a left hip fracture as a result of the fall and underwent an uncomplicated surgical repair. She was ultimately readmitted to the original skilled nursing facility with severely limited mobility secondary to the surgery. At the time of readmission, she was essentially bedbound, unable to transfer to a chair or her wheelchair.

A few weeks later, she continued to remain bedbound with little progress in her functional status. One morning when the nurse was delivering her morning medications, the patient was found to be confused and combative where previously she had been alert, oriented, and always very pleasant. She was febrile to 102°F and had a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, which was lower than her usual. Because of concerns for an acute infection, she was transferred to an acute care hospital.

At the hospital, a full examination revealed a very deep pressure ulcer in her sacrum (stage IV full thickness ulcer), which had developed at the long-term care facility after her hip fracture. Unfortunately, likely secondary to an infection of the pressure ulcer, she developed septic shock and died 3 days later despite maximal efforts.

================================================================================

Title: A Seasonal Care Transition Failure

The Case:
A 70-year-old healthy man presented to his primary care doctor—a third-year internal medicine resident—for routine follow-up. The resident was in his final month of training, and would leave the institution for fellowship at the completion of his residency.

After discussion, the provider sent off a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to screen the patient for prostate cancer. The patient's past PSA tests had always been normal. Unfortunately, this time his PSA returned markedly elevated at 83 ng/ml—a level at which cancer is a near certainty. The patient was not immediately notified as the electronic alert (via an existing electronic health record) was sent to the patient's primary care provider. However, because this provider had graduated and left the program before the alert returned, and there was no system to ensure smooth handoffs to oncoming residents, the alert went unread.

Eight months later, the patient presented with new onset low back pain. Imaging tests confirmed metastatic prostate cancer and also uncovered the missed follow-up of the elevated PSA.

================================================================================

Title: Patient Safety and Adherence to Self-Administered Medications

The Case:
A 30-year-old man, with HIV and a recent diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis, returned to the emergency department (ED) of a community hospital for the third time in two weeks.

Two months earlier, the patient was diagnosed at a university hospital with toxoplasmosis, based on characteristic brain lesions on MRI and presence of the parasite's DNA in his cerebrospinal fluid (via polymerase chain reaction). He was discharged on standard treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis (pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid) and HIV disease (anti-retroviral medications). Two weeks before this ED visit, he was admitted to the community hospital with seizures. Imaging showed no change in the brain lesions. He was discharged on the anti-seizure medication phenytoin. The day before this ED visit, the patient had a second seizure that led to a motor vehicle accident. He was brought to the community hospital's ED, an MRI of his brain showed no change, and he was discharged home.

He returned the next day, this time complaining of new onset right-sided weakness. Compared to the MRI one day earlier, CT showed increased swelling of his brain and compression of his frontal lobe. Medical staff were now worried that this patient had treatment-resistant toxoplasmosis or another brain disease, and transferred him to the university hospital where the original diagnosis had been made.

During the workup at the university hospital, the patient said that his symptoms had improved after he was initially discharged two months earlier. However, one month earlier, he ran out of his medications for toxoplasmosis. He did not have any refills and did not know how to obtain refills. He continued the anti-retroviral HIV medications for which he had refills. Soon after stopping the toxoplasmosis medications he began to experience headaches, then seizures and other symptoms that led to his multiple presentations over the prior two weeks. The patient was restarted on appropriate therapy for CNS toxoplasmosis and his symptoms improved.

================================================================================

Title: Say It Again

The Case:
A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia and hyponatremia. During his third hospital night, the on-call physician was contacted by the charge nurse, who had received a "critical panic value" call for a potassium level of 2.2 (normal=3.5-5). The physician began writing for an EKG and immediate potassium supplementation. While writing the orders, he quickly glanced in the electronic health record to see what the patient's previous potassium levels were. To his surprise, he discovered that the patient didn't have a potassium level listed in the computer for that day; nor was there evidence that one had been ordered or drawn.

After calling the charge nurse back, they discovered the panic value was intended for a different patient with a similar last name on the unit. It was unclear if a "read-back" occurred between the lab tech and the charge nurse, who was covering for the patient's bedside nurse while the latter was on her break. Luckily, this was a "near miss"—the patient did not receive the unnecessary and potentially dangerous potassium supplementation and had an otherwise uneventful hospital course.

================================================================================

Title: Routine Goes Awry

The Case:
A 6-year-old girl with a history of asthma and chronic adenotonsillitis was referred to a surgeon and scheduled for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. She was in otherwise good health, had never received anesthesia in the past, and was experiencing no acute symptoms at the time of surgery. After an uneventful surgical procedure, the patient was rapidly extubated with spontaneous ventilation and stable vital signs. Within an hour, however, the patient became hypoxic with an inability to ventilate spontaneously, and required reintubation. The etiology of the need for reintubation was unclear but thought to be related to sedation and analgesia administered during and after the case. The patient ultimately recovered with no additional complications and was discharged home with her parents.

Because of the reintubation, the case generated additional review and discussion, including concerns expressed by the parents about the safety of what they believed was a routine surgical procedure done on children every day.

================================================================================

Title: Outbreak

The Case:
A 36-year-old healthy man developed an acute febrile illness associated with a vesicular rash. He presented to an urgent care clinic where he was diagnosed with varicella infection ("chicken pox"). The patient did not recall a sick contact or exposure to varicella, but he did report working in an emergency department (ED). He was initially treated with oral acyclovir, but the progression of his lesions eventually required a brief hospitalization for dehydration and acute renal failure. His condition ultimately improved and his symptoms resolved.

The ED worker later learned from his supervisor that a patient had presented to the ED with chicken pox during one of his shifts, and his exposure likely occurred at that time. He raised concern that his illness could have been prevented had proper procedures been in place. His case prompted extensive discussion of infection control procedures among the ED leadership, given that many ED providers were exposed to this highly communicable disease.

================================================================================

Title: Pocket Syringe Swap

The Case:
A 58-year-old man, scheduled for aortoiliac artery bypass graft, had an epidural catheter placed for postoperative pain management. Surgery proceeded uneventfully under general anesthesia. During the closure of the surgical incision, the surgery fellow drew 12 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (a local anesthetic) into a 12 mL labeled syringe of which 4 mL was injected into the epidural space. The fellow subsequently placed the bupivacaine syringe with the remaining 8 mL of the drug in the pocket of his scrub suit.

Anticipating the conclusion of surgery, the fellow prepared a second 12 mL syringe drawing up 4 mL of neostigmine (4 mg) and 4 mL of glycopyrrolate (0.8 mg) totaling 8 mL and labeled it, adding this syringe to the same pocket of his scrubs. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure, the attending asked the fellow to reverse the neuromuscular block with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. The fellow pulled a syringe out of his pocket, assumed it contained the neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, and injected 6 mL and then placed the syringe back in his pocket.

After 3 minutes, the patient still appeared weak (i.e., with residual neuromuscular blockade), and the attending requested administration of an additional 1 mg of neostigmine. When the fellow retrieved a syringe from his pocket, he recognized that he had previously pulled the wrong syringe and inadvertently administered bupivacaine, the anesthetic, rather than neostigmine/glycopyrrolate. Once the correct medication was administered, neuromuscular blockade was reversed. Although the patient was not harmed by the erroneous intravenous (IV) administration of bupivacaine, he potentially could have been.

================================================================================

Title: Duty to Disclose Someone Else's Error?

The Case:
A healthy 4-year-old boy presented to an emergency department (ED) with 3 days of vomiting associated with lethargy and fevers. He had been exposed to another child with streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) the previous week but otherwise had been well until the symptoms began. He received a full evaluation in the ED. He was found to have a low-grade fever and was a little sleepy with some redness in his throat. The laboratory tests were unremarkable and a head computed tomography (CT) was reported as normal by the radiologist. A rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis was positive.

The child was admitted to the hospital for ongoing care and given intravenous hydration and antibiotics. Over the next 24 hours, the child became increasingly confused, disoriented, and lethargic. The following morning, his condition worsened and he had a respiratory arrest. He was placed on a ventilator and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

In the ICU, he was noted to have fixed and dilated pupils on neurologic exam, a sign of serious neurologic injury. A repeat CT scan of the brain revealed severe cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) with evidence of herniation of the brain through the base of the skull.

He was transferred from this hospital to a tertiary care center for ongoing management. At the tertiary care center, the child was evaluated by neurology and neurosurgical teams. Further testing revealed a diagnosis of venous sinus thromboses (blood clots in the veins of the brain), which had led to edema and herniation. Unfortunately, the brain damage was too advanced and the child was determined to have no chance to survive.

As part of their routine evaluation, the neurology, neurosurgical teams, and the radiologists at the tertiary care center reviewed the CT scan that had been done in the original ED. Although the findings were subtle, they found that the scan was not normal (as had been reported) but demonstrated clear evidence of cerebral edema. The initial hospital had not recognized these findings and therefore had not pursued further work-up for the cause, which would have been indicated. The neurology and neurosurgical teams thought that if the brain swelling had been recognized at the time, the child could have been transferred earlier, received surgical management, and might have survived.

When it was clear the child could not survive, the pediatricians met with the mother and father to explain that their child was brain dead. Angry and upset, the parents asked repeatedly, "How could this happen? How could the CT scan have been normal and then be so bad in less than 48 hours?"

Due to concerns of legal liability, the hospital administration and the risk management department at the tertiary care hospital had instructed the physicians and other providers to not disclose the misinterpretation of the original CT scan. In fact, they were instructed not to comment on the care provided by the initial hospital in any way. Therefore the parents were never told that an error had been made that may have contributed to their child's death.



================================================================================

Title: Dropping the Ball Despite an Integrated EMR

The Case:
A patient followed at a community-based clinic that is part of a large health care system with an inpatient/outpatient electronic medical record (EMR) presented to the emergency department (ED) with a fractured humerus. The patient was seen by a physicians assistant (PA), treated with a sling and analgesics, and referred to an orthopedics consultant. The referral was made through the system's EMR referral module.

The appointment had to be rescheduled twice due to transportation problems. The health care system caring for the patient has a quality standard that a patient must be seen in follow-up within 30 days of a referral. The hospital automatically cancels appointments when patients miss them to minimize black marks on these 30-day reports and asks the original ordering provider to enter a new consult request to restart the 30-day clock.

A secretary at the hospital canceled the appointment, as per protocol, and assumed that the ordering physician would receive an automatic notice of the cancellation, which would then prompt her to enter another referral request. However, because the ordering provider was the PA from the ED, not the primary care physician (PCP), the latter did not receive notification that the appointment was canceled. Presumably, the PA and ED physician, who did receive the notice, thought the PCP had also received the notice and was taking responsibility for the patient's follow-up care, and so they took no action.

Luckily, the error was recognized when the patient finally saw his PCP. At that point, an orthopedics referral was made. While the error led to a delay in follow-up, the patient had no further complications.

================================================================================

Title: Volume Too Low: In and Out

The Case:
A 22-month-old infant was admitted to the hospital in the late afternoon with a viral infection. He had a complex past medical history including congenital heart disease, poor feeding requiring a gastric tube, and delayed cognitive development. At the time of admission, he was moderately ill appearing but remained interactive with his mother and hospital staff. He was given appropriate therapies for his viral infection.

Later in the evening, the infant drank 2 ounces (60 mL) of a liquid nutritional drink and then went to sleep; this was the sum total of his fluid consumption since hospital admission. The child slept well and in the morning his vital signs were all normal. He remained interactive but seemed a bit sleepy. His total urine output overnight as documented by the nurse was 50 mL (a low urine output given his weight of 10 kg). The night nurse communicated the minimal intake of fluids and poor urine output to the day nurse at the 7:00 AM change of shift.

The day nurse, busy caring for other patients, failed to appreciate the significance of the low intake and output. Over the next few hours, the infant became more somnolent and less responsive. His aunt assumed this was due to the viral infection, and the child was not evaluated by the nurse during this time. When his mother returned in the early afternoon, she found her son to be lethargic and acting strangely. Evaluation by the intern revealed a low blood pressure, high heart rate, decreased muscle tone, and decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Stat labs revealed severe hypoglycemia and dehydration. The infant was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit where an IV was placed and he was given intravenous fluids and intravenous glucose. He required 2 days in the intensive care unit but did not experience any long-term consequences.

Title: Are We Pushing Graduate Nurses Too Fast?

The Case:
A middle-aged man was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) following a complex surgical procedure performed for pancreatic cancer. He was on a ventilator, and several attempts to wean had been unsuccessful. The patient was also in acute renal failure. His current treatment included vasoactive drugs, intravenous fluids and nutrients, sedation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and mechanical ventilation.

The registered nurse (RN) caring for this patient had completed nursing school 1 year earlier and had worked in this SICU since graduation; she had completed the hospital-based CRRT training in the prior month. In this hospital, RNs who regularly cared for SICU patients administered CRRT along with other care needed by the patient. RNs received special training in this technique from expert nurses in this hospital and received a certificate from the hospital after demonstrating their knowledge and skill.

The CRRT machine is supposed to have a bag of dialysate (solution with the appropriate chemicals and nutrients) infusing, and an ultrafiltrate bag connected to an outflow line, collecting the fluid being removed from the patient. During a conversation between two more senior nurses in the central nursing station, one glanced at the CRRT machine and noticed no dialysate bags; instead, there were two sets of ultrafiltrate bags. One set, full to capacity, was appropriately hooked into the ultrafiltrate line; the other empty set was hooked to the dialysate line. The senior nurse immediately stopped the CRRT machine and questioned the new graduate nurse caring for the patient. The newly trained nurse stated that there were no more bags of dialysate on the unit and she was trying to maintain the machine until some new bags arrived.

Before the new bags arrived and the CRRT could be restarted, the patient deteriorated and was taken back to surgery. He expired not long after from a perforated bowel.

Although the nurse's error in setting up the CRRT machine was not the direct cause of the patient's death, it did raise many questions. CRRT is a high-risk procedure that is handled differently by different hospitals. In some, only specially trained dialysis nurses administer this treatment; in others; the nurses on the units receive in-service training and manage the CRRT themselves. Questions that confronted the staff and critical care director for this unit were how to restructure the orientation and training programs to ensure that staff performing high-risk procedures were sufficiently prepared to anticipate problems, plan ahead, troubleshoot, and safely carry out the therapy.

Title: Silent Pain in the Neck

The Case:
A 60-year-old man with no significant past medical history underwent an elective anterior cervical discectomy for persistent right arm weakness due to cervical stenosis. After an uncomplicated procedure, the patient was transferred to a surgical unit with stable vital signs. Later that night, he developed tightness and swelling on the right side of his neck. The nurse notified the covering physician, who asked about stridor or other respiratory symptoms. When told they were absent, he recommended continued close observation. Over the next few hours, the patient's symptoms persisted, and he noted the onset of mild dysphagia. The nurse contacted the in-house intensivist, who evaluated the patient and once again found no evidence of respiratory distress or stridor.

A few hours later, the patient stood up from bed to use the urinal, began coughing, turned cyanotic, and fell to the floor unconscious. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started, but the patient's airway was significantly compromised by a now obvious neck hematoma. An emergent tracheostomy was performed at the bedside and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.

This postoperative complication led to a prolonged hospitalization. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, where he required lengthy rehabilitation services.

================================================================================

Title: Paradoxical Pulse

The Case:
An 80-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and symptomatic bradycardia underwent successful pacemaker placement as an outpatient. The patient was restarted on his warfarin therapy and returned home with no complaints.

A week later, the patient developed new diffuse chest discomfort that progressed over the ensuing 24 hours to include associated dyspnea and nausea. He presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation where he was noted to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 113/66, heart rate of 95, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. On physical examination, he appeared comfortable and in no distress. His cardiac exam was notable only for flat neck veins, an irregularly irregular rhythm, a well-healed pacer site, and no peripheral edema. Laboratory studies revealed a stable hemoglobin level, a negative troponin, and an INR of 2.6 (within the therapeutic range), but a slightly elevated creatinine and a new transaminitis (elevated liver tests) compared to a week ago. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation but no evidence of ischemia. Imaging studies included a chest x-ray, which was normal, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, which revealed a pericardial effusion but no hepatobiliary pathology.

The ED physician discussed the case and CT findings with the on-call cardiologist who recommended admission but no need for an urgent echocardiogram given the normal vital signs and the patient's clinical stability. The following day, the patient's echocardiogram confirmed a large pericardial effusion "without tamponade" physiology. Providers continued to remark about the patient's clinical stability based on vital signs and appearance. Later that day, the patient became acutely hypotensive, developed ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity, and required emergent resuscitative measures, including large drainage of a pericardial effusion to relieve his cardiac tamponade. While surviving the emergent resuscitation, the patient ultimately suffered additional complications and passed away after a prolonged hospital course.

================================================================================

Title: Failure to Reevaluate

The Case:
A 61-year-old woman receiving palliative chemotherapy for non–small-cell lung cancer at a community hospital developed methicillin-resistantstaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) bacteremia and endophthalmitis originating from her port. Vancomycin 1.25 grams intravenously twice daily was initiated, and the patient was transferred to a large academic medical center for ophthalmologic consultation and further treatment. Vancomycin was continued upon transfer until she was found to have a rapidly rising serum creatinine (Scr). The initial Scr was 0.4 mg/dL at the community hospital; it had increased to 0.8 mg/dL on admission to the receiving facility and was apparently interpreted as "normal," since it still fell within "normal" range. The patient was recognized to be in acute renal failure when her creatinine reached 1.09 mg/dL the day after transfer. Notably, the vancomycin trough at this time was 64 mg/L. The vancomycin blood level had not been checked previously throughout her treatment.

As a result of her renal failure, the patient rapidly developed non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and, 5 days after transfer, required urgent dialysis for volume overload and worsening acid-base status. Urine and blood studies failed to identify a clear cause of her renal failure. At present, the patient continues to be anuric and dialysis dependent, and she will likely leave the hospital receiving palliative chemotherapy and a 6-week course of vancomycin. She has a new tunneled catheter for ongoing dialysis treatments.



================================================================================

Title: Milliliters vs. Milligrams

The Case:


A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after a vehicle collision and multiple traumatic injuries. His evaluation showed acute cerebral edema. An order for intravenous dexamethasone was written, with the dosing schedule specified as "10 mg IV stat, then 8 mg q 6 hrs x 2 doses, then 4 mg q 6 hrs x 2 doses, then 4 mg q 6 hrs for 2 doses, then 2 mg q 6 hrs x 2 doses." The pharmacist processed the order, dispensing a multidose 4 mg/mL 5 mL vial to the unit. The vial, containing a total of 20 mg dexamethasone, was anticipated to furnish the stat 10 mg dose and the second 8 mg dose to be given 6 hours later. The pharmacist labeled the vial, instructing the nurse regarding the necessary volume (mL) to be drawn from the vial to provide the appropriate dose (mg). After 1 hour, the nurse called the pharmacist requesting more dexamethasone, stating there was no medication available for the second dose. After questioning the nurse, the pharmacist determined that the patient was given the entire vial (20 mg) as the initial (stat) dose, a twofold overdose. The attending physician was contacted and informed of the error. Since the patient was given only one dose, no harm was expected. Subsequent dexamethasone doses were given as ordered, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

================================================================================

Title: Reconciling Records

The Case:


Case 1.A patient receiving care at a Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic was admitted to a local teaching hospital. When discharged, he was instructed to "resume" taking torsemide, although he had never taken this powerful diuretic previously. In his first follow-up appointment with his usual physician at the VA outpatient clinic, he requested a refill of the torsemide. His medication record showed that he had been taking terazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to the hospitalization; there was no record of his being on torsemide. When questioned about it, the patient said he had told the emergency department (ED) staff that he was taking a medicine whose name started with the letter T to make him urinate. The ED staff had entered torsemide into the electronic medical record. When discharged, this came up as an at-home medication, and he was instructed to resume taking it. When he came to see his primary MD at the VA clinic requesting a medication he didn't need and hadn't taken before, the error was detected.

Case 2.At another local teaching hospital, a family had given incorrect data to the ED staff (including listing the patient as being on prednisolone rather than prednisone), and the physicians caring for the patient had simply checked off the option to continue the home medications. When the records were carefully reviewed by a physician consulting for an upcoming cardiac procedure, almost all of the medications were found to be incorrect. Had the cardiologist assumed that the other physicians and nurses had accurately entered the medications, the errors would have gone undetected, and the patient's chronic steroid dependence might have not been appropriately addressed perioperatively. Fortunately, no harm occurred.

================================================================================

Title: Mother's Milk, but Whose Mother?

The Case:


A 2-month-old otherwise healthy infant was admitted to the hospital to rule out sepsis. The infant had been exclusively breastfed since the time of his birth.

In light of the difficulties associated with regular breastfeeding in the hospital, the mother stored her pumped breast milk in the refrigerator on the infant's ward in the hospital. At the time of the first feeding, a nurse's aide retrieved a bottle from the refrigerator, a bottle labeled only with the mother's room number and two initials. Approximately 5 minutes later, after giving the child 15 mL of the breast milk, the mother noticed that the initials on the bottle were not those of her son and called a staff member to the room, who promptly involved the child's main nurse.

The nurse and nurse's aide reviewed the events and suggested to the mother that the administered milk might, in fact, be hers—despite the fact that the initials on the bottle were not those of her child. Upon further review, it was noted that the initials matched those of the nurse's aide who separated the original milk container into small feeding bottles. The mother, skeptical that the milk was hers, asked that the nurses search the refrigerator. There, they found another bottle, labeled with the room number and the child's initials, that clearly was the mother's milk. In other words, they confirmed that the patient had unquestionably received 15 mL of the wrong human milk.

On further investigation, they learned that the mistaken milk sample actually belonged to the patient who previously occupied that room. Although that patient had since been discharged, the breast milk remained in the refrigerator. An infectious diseases consult subsequently counseled the family regarding potential risks from using the wrong breast milk. Additional laboratory testing revealed that no infectious transmission had occurred, and no other objective harm was identified by the time of discharge.

================================================================================

Title: The Deadly Duo

The Case:


A 29-year-old man with a history of depression and possible psychosis was found unconscious and unresponsive at home and was brought to the emergency department. He was tachycardic, hypertensive, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. His electrocardiogram  revealed tachycardia, QT prolongation, QRS widening, and a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, all evidence of potentially dangerous heart rhythms. He was intubated for airway protection and given activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube to treat a presumed drug overdose. He was also treated with a bicarbonate drip, which can help suppress overdose-related arrhythmias.

Further history obtained from the paramedics revealed that the patient had been prescribed amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) and risperidone (an antipsychotic medication) by his primary care physician to treat his psychiatric conditions. Empty bottles of both were found on the floor near the patient at his home, and it was presumed that he had overdosed on the medications as a suicide attempt. The patient survived the episode without any life-threatening arrhythmias and was transferred to an inpatient psychiatric ward once he was stabilized.

================================================================================

Title: "Recurrent" Appendicitis

The Case:
An 85-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with right lower quadrant pain. On physical examination, the patient showed rebound tenderness with guarding. He received a CT scan of his abdomen, which revealed an inflamed, dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for laparoscopic appendectomy. The surgeon had recently joined the medical staff after completing a general surgery residency and then a breast surgery fellowship, and so was still subject to proctoring. The operative report notes that two other surgeons came into the OR to confirm that the appendix was removed with no retained tissue.

Postoperatively, the patient continued to have right lower quadrant pain, which led to a repeat CT scan showing inflammatory changes in the right pericecal region. Because the pathological specimen from the appendectomy had not yet been read, the pathologist was called to determine whether there were some findings that might explain the patient's persistent symptoms. When she examined the specimen, she found no appendiceal tissue.

The patient was emergently taken back to the OR, and the appendix was located and excised. The patient had a stormy postoperative course, complicated by aspiration pneumonia requiring intubation, but ultimately made a full recovery.

================================================================================

Title: Dangerous Dialysis

The Case:
A 48-year-old man with a long history of diabetes and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis arrived at his outpatient dialysis center for his scheduled Friday morning session. Before starting dialysis, his nephrologist sat down next to him and stated that a serious error had occurred at the dialysis center. The nephrologist told the patient that, for a number of dialysis sessions, he had been dialyzed using a dialysis membrane that had been inappropriately reused, which meant that he had been exposed to another patient's blood many times.

The dialysis center was actually not sure which dialysis membrane had been reused, so they couldn't identify the specific patients affected by this error. Thus, they were informing all patients who had potentially been exposed to a communicable disease. At this dialysis center, many patients had HIV and hepatitis C, so it was conceivable that this particular patient had been exposed.

The patient was tested for HIV and hepatitis viruses and was treated for 3 months with postexposure prophylaxis for HIV. Ultimately, repeated blood tests were negative for HIV and hepatitis, meaning that the patient did not experience any long-term consequences.



================================================================================

Title: Emergent Triage Miss

The Case:


A 42-year-old woman presented to a busy urban emergency department (ED) and approached the triage nurse. The patient told the triage nurse that she had "3 days of face and tongue swelling." She also said that, in the previous 2 weeks, she had two intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for similar complaints and that she had required intubation in one of those instances.

The triage nurse documented that the patient was "speaking in full sentences" and "swallowing secretions." The vital signs at triage, including respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, were normal. The triage nurse decided that this was "urgent" and not "emergent," and therefore the patient was asked to wait in the waiting room.

The patient sat in the waiting room for more than 2 hours before she was finally placed into a room in the ED. It was another hour after that before a physician evaluated her. By that time, her tongue and throat had swollen substantially, and she was having difficulty breathing. She required emergency intubation, a potentially dangerous and high-risk procedure, and aggressive treatment with intravenous epinephrine, steroids, and nebulizers.

The patient was given a diagnosis of angioedema—rapid swelling of the skin and tissues around the mouth and throat. She was admitted to the ICU and had an uncomplicated 5-day hospital stay. The patient experienced no major long-term consequences.

The case was discussed in the departmental quality conference. When asked why she did not bring the patient into the ED more emergently, the triage nurse responded, "I didn't think the patient was telling the truth about her recent intubation."

================================================================================

Title: Missed Patient Assignment: Is Anyone There?

The Case:


In one hospital, nurses' patient assignments were communicated by listing the room numbers next to each nurse's name in a computerized tool. At the beginning of a new shift, the oncoming nurses listen to the taped report for each patient in their assigned rooms.

At the start of one particular evening shift, a nurse was assigned five rooms to cover per the paper assignment list. However, the taped report for one of the bed locations was empty. She concluded that the room had been vacated and was now available for a new admission or transfer.

The nurse made rounds on each of the patients for whom she had a report at the beginning of the shift, completing the assessments, medications, and treatments for each one. Mid-shift, the charge nurse inquired if there were any status changes or other pertinent information regarding any of the assigned patients. The nurse stated that there were none. Near the end of the shift, the nurse recorded a report on her four patients. At the end of the shift, the charge nurse asked why there wasn't a taped report on the fifth assigned patient.

This came as a surprise, as the nurse had never seen the fifth patient. She quickly visited the patient and completed necessary assessments and care. Fortunately, the patient was stable, was scheduled to be discharged in the morning, and had not been scheduled to receive any medications or tests during that shift. He was not harmed.

The concern for this neglected patient and the potential for similar events in the future led to a root cause analysis. The underlying cause was determined to be the lack of confirmation of patient assignments by the accepting nurse. There were multiple contributing causes. On this unit and throughout the hospital, there were varying procedures for creating, checking, and distributing nursing assignment lists by different charge nurses and different, or sometimes no, methods for acknowledging assignments.

As a result, a rapid cycle improvement was conducted, and its recommendations were implemented on all inpatient units. First, nurses were to do an independent double-check of the nursing assignment list made by the charge nurse using consistent symbols with standardized meanings. Second, at shift change, oncoming nurses would be required to enter their own names next to the names of patients they had been assigned in the electronic patient tracking tool. This would acknowledge communication of assigned patients. Lastly, the charge nurse would compare the assignment list to the completed electronic sign-in tool and address any discrepancies.

================================================================================

Title: Acute Respiratory Arrest in Pregnancy

The Case:


A 35-year-old woman was 38 weeks pregnant with twins (G3P2). When she developed acute onset of shortness of breath and hemoptysis (coughing up blood), her husband called 911. Shortly after paramedics arrived, the patient experienced a respiratory and cardiac arrest. CPR was administered, and she successfully regained a pulse. Upon hospital arrival, the patient was rushed to the operating room for emergency C-section. Two infants were delivered stillborn, with Apgar scores of 0 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes. The patient was transferred to the ICU with hypoxic encephalopathy; she eventually recovered.

Review of her medical records revealed that the patient had a history of chronic hypertension, which had worsened during her third trimester; it had been managed by increasing the dose of her chronic antihypertensive medication (labetalol). A few weeks prior to admission, after the patient complained of shortness of breath, her obstetrician prescribed her albuterol. Two days prior to admission, the patient presented to the obstetrics clinic with blood pressures (BPs) in the range of 170-210/100-125. Fetal non-stress testing was normal. At that visit, the nursing notes indicate some concern about preeclampsia. However, the physician did not order further evaluation, in part because "preeclampsia labs" had recently been performed and were found normal.

================================================================================

Title: Tacit Handover, Overt Mishap

The Case:


A 61-year-old man was admitted for management of an infected aortic stent, which had been placed 3 years earlier to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In preparation for surgical removal of the infected stent and graft repair of the abdominal aorta, a spinal drain was placed by an anesthesiologist. The spinal drain, a small soft catheter, was inserted into the lower spinal cord to remove cerebrospinal fluid—these drains lower pressure in the spinal cord and thereby reduce the risk for post-surgery paralysis.

The patient underwent uncomplicated removal of the infected stent and graft repair of the aorta. Per protocol, the spinal drain remained in place for 48 hours after the procedure. At that time, the anesthesiologist attempted to remove the drain, but aggressive pulling resulted only in stretching of the catheter. Concerned about causing injury to the patient, he consulted a neurosurgeon who recommended that further attempts to remove the catheter be done under general anesthesia in the operating room (OR) in hopes that anesthesia would relax the back muscles. The patient was placed on the OR schedule for the following day. The anesthesiologist and neurosurgeon both clearly documented the plan of care in the chart.

The following morning, the five anesthesiologists on duty met to discuss all of the cases scheduled for the day, including the catheter removal, so all of them were aware of the plan. Unfortunately, because of prolonged surgeries, the case was pushed to the end of the day. By that point, the anesthesiologist on call for the night had arrived, unaware of any of the treatment plans. She noticed that this case was labeled "Spinal Drain Removal" on the schedule. Confident that she knew how to manage these devices, she approached the head anesthesiologist for the day and asked if she could "take care of the spinal drain case." The head anesthesiologist knew that she had experience in the area and simply said "yes" without conveying any further information. The on-call anesthesiologist did not review the patient's chart or obtain any further information.

Unaware of the plan for general anesthesia, the on-call anesthesiologist proceeded to try to pull out the drain while the patient was awake in the preoperative area. Unfortunately, the catheter broke, leaving a portion inside the spinal canal. Consequently, the neurosurgeon had no choice but to surgically remove the catheter. Luckily, the patient suffered no major consequences, but was at risk for spinal cord injury and had to undergo a second surgical procedure.



================================================================================

Title: Fatal Error in Neonate: Does "Just Culture" Provide an Answer?

The Case:
An infant was born prematurely at 30 weeks weighing only 1.8 kg. In the neonatal intensive care unit, he was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with Premasol amino acid solution at 3 g/kg/d and dextrose 12.5%, 5 mg/kg/min. After being maintained using those solutions for the first 2 days after delivery, the care team added lipids on day 3. This was ordered as lipid emulsion 20% at a rate of 0.19 mL/hr.

The neonatal intensive care unit had frequent orders for this treatment and kept a stock of lipid emulsion on site. This practice avoided the delay between ordering, sending the order to the pharmacy, and waiting for the pharmacy to dispense the new TPN solution.

Within 4 hours of beginning the lipid emulsion administration through the TPN line using a smart pump, the infant's condition worsened. He showed signs of respiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, coagulopathy, and liver failure. Soon after, the infant suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

As the symptoms displayed by this premature infant suggested lipid overload, the dose and rate of administration of the lipid formulation were assessed. Assessment revealed that the pump was set to deliver 19.0 mL/hr. In the process of calculating the dose with the concentration of lipid emulsion available on the unit, the RN had erroneously set the pump to deliver 100 times the ordered dose of 0.19 mL/hr. Upon discovery of the error, the nurse involved was fired by the hospital and her license was revoked. The sequence of events and underlying reasons for the error were not investigated further.



================================================================================

Title: Anticoagulation: Held Too Long

The Case:


A 68-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve was admitted with abdominal pain. Because of the mechanical valve, she was chronically on warfarin (a blood thinner). At the time of admission, herinternational normalized ratio(INR) was 1.3, indicating that she was under-anticoagulated—her blood was not appropriately "thinned" to prevent possible clots from forming on her mechanical valve. She was treated with unfractionated heparin, a continuously delivered intravenous medication, which quickly thinned her blood appropriately.

Based on her abdominal complaints, a gastroenterology consultant wished to pursue esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a procedure in which a camera is inserted through the mouth and into the stomach. The gastroenterologist wanted the patient to be off all blood thinners to prevent bleeding complications and in case he needed to do biopsies.

The admitting team caring for the patient wrote an order to stop the heparin at 5:00 pm on the day before the EGD as well as an order to restart it 48 hours afterward. Unfortunately, the order to restart the heparin was missed, and the heparin was not restarted after the procedure. Four days after the EGD, the team noticed that the patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a different marker of blood thinning (one that goes up in response to heparin), was normal and realized that the patient was not being anticoagulated appropriately by the heparin. The heparin was quickly restarted, and the patient was eventually discharged. She did not suffer any negative consequences, but her prolonged period off anticoagulants put her at high risk for acute stroke from blood clots on her mechanical valve.

================================================================================

Title: Nosy Business

The Case:


A 59-year-old man with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presented to the emergency department (ED) with epistaxis (a "nose bleed"). He reported no previous history of epistaxis and stated that the symptoms began spontaneously a few hours prior to presentation. He was treated with "conservative" therapy after his platelet count was found to be normal and discharged home. He returned to the ED 24 hours later with recurrence of epistaxis and was once again discharged home after the bleeding stopped spontaneously. When he presented with epistaxis for the third time in 72 hours, he was noted to be tachycardic and pale. He had developed a new anemia, but his platelet count remained normal and his tachycardia resolved with intravenous fluids.

The ED providers initially placed nasal tampons bilaterally, but his brisk bleeding continued. Otolaryngology was consulted and, after removing the tampons, they identified the posterior nasopharynx as the site of bleeding under direct visualization. After attempted cautery and nasal packing, the bleeding recurred within an hour. The patient ultimately underwent a procedure to have his sphenopalatine artery embolized by interventional radiology. Because the patient's platelet count remained normal through the bleeding episodes, a hematology consultant felt that the patient's ITP had not contributed to the epistaxis. The patient's symptoms resolved, he received 4 units of packed red blood cells, and he was discharged home with no immediate recurrence.

================================================================================

Title: Defensive Medicine: "Glowing" with Pain

The Case:


A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient was well known to the ED staff (a "frequent flyer") as he had presented multiple times in the previous 2 years with similar complaints, always requesting intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for the pain. In fact, he had been seen in the ED 2 days earlier by the same physician who was on duty. At that time, the patient's examination was benign, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen and pelvis was normal. He was discharged home with a prescription for hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Vicodin).

On this visit, the patient stated that his abdominal pain and vomiting had not significantly improved over the prior 2 days. His vital signs were normal, and his abdominal exam was unremarkable, with no tenderness, guarding, or masses. The ED physician ordered laboratory tests and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, all of which were normal. Because of his persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted to the hospital. An evaluation by a gastroenterologist failed to reveal a clear cause for the symptoms, and the patient was discharged to home after 2 days in the hospital feeling somewhat better.

As part of a targeted review of intravenous hydromorphone use in the ED, the Medical Director came across this case. When she looked back over the prior 2 years, the patient had been seen in the ED 12 times for abdominal complaints and had received 12 CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. All of them were completely normal. When she reviewed the clinical details for each of the 12 presentations to the ED, she felt strongly that most, if not all, of the CT scans were not clinically indicated. When she discussed the patient with the providers involved, many of the physicians expressed that the CT scans (and many other tests) were ordered out of "fear of getting sued"—as a safeguard against possible malpractice liability. The Medical Director was frustrated and wondered about the costs—to the health care system and to patients—of practicing this "defensive medicine."

================================================================================

Title: Medication Reconciliation Pitfalls

The Case:
A 90-year-old woman who lived alone suffered a mechanical fall with subsequent hip fracture and was brought to the emergency department (ED) by her daughter. The patient had a past medical history of hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and hypertension. The patient's medication bottles were given to the ED triage nurse and were used to generate a list of home medications. Among others, the list included "Toprol-XL 75 mg po daily." An orthopedic surgeon admitted the patient to the hospital and wrote orders to continue all of her home medications at their prior dosages. The surgeon also requested an internal medicine consultation for "preoperative clearance." The patient denied any history of arrhythmia, syncope, presyncope, dementia, or prior falls. Her medications were placed in an opaque, plastic personal-belongings bag along with her clothes, and she was moved to the orthopedic floor.

Several hours later, the consulting hospitalist performed an evaluation and confirmed the patient's home medications and their dosages. Other than her leg trauma and a mild hearing deficit, the patient's examination was normal. She did not inform the hospitalist that the medications were in her hospital bag; in fact, she may not have even realized that her daughter had left them there with her. The hospitalist noted a heart rate of 75 beats per minute with a systolic blood pressure of 170 mmHg. Blood pressure readings had been high since admission. An order was written to increase Toprol-XL from 75 mg to 100 mg daily.

While being prepped on the operating room table several hours later, the patient developed asystole, underwent successful resuscitation, and was transferred to the ICU. Upon transfer, an ICU nurse handed the plastic bag of medications to the consulting cardiologist who noted that the patient's home dosage of Toprol-XL was 25 mg daily. The error was reported to the hospital pharmacy. Only by coincidence did the hospitalist who had increased the Toprol-XL dosage learn of the error. The hospitalist apologized to the patient and her family and assured them that the case would be carefully reviewed to ensure that a similar error wouldn't happen again.

The patient made a full recovery and had no recurrent vital sign instability. Myocardial infarction was ruled out, and an echocardiogram was normal. After observation in the ICU for several days, she underwent repair of her hip fracture and was discharged to home without further complications.



================================================================================

Title: Round-Trip Service

The Case:


A 70-year-old man with a long history of degenerative joint disease was experiencing increased symptoms in his left knee. He was referred by his primary care provider to an orthopedic surgeon who recommended a total knee replacement. The patient was eager for the surgery so he could return to his active lifestyle, but the elective procedure couldn't be scheduled for a couple of months. In addition to the delays with scheduling, the patient also became concerned about the costs associated with the surgery and his likely postoperative rehabilitation needs.

Based on a neighbor's recommendation, the patient explored alternate options and ultimately had his total knee replacement performed overseas. The surgery was scheduled within 2 weeks, at a fraction of the cost to the patient of domestic surgery, and provided a very satisfying experience overall. Approximately 2 weeks after the surgery, when the patient was back home, he developed acute pain and swelling in his surgically repaired knee. He contacted the US-based orthopedic surgeon who originally saw him, explained the circumstances, and was told he could not be seen because "we didn't perform the surgery, so you should contact your operating surgeon." The patient was ultimately seen in the emergency department and received appropriate treatment for uncomplicated postoperative swelling.

Title: "Superficial" Report Leads to "Deep" Problem

The Case:


A 35-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of left foot and ankle pain for the past 7 days. The patient denied any recent trauma to her leg and had no fever or respiratory symptoms. She had no other medical history, and her only medication was an oral contraceptive. She reported smoking one pack of cigarettes daily and drinking alcohol occasionally, but denied illicit drug use. The patient's mother had a history of a "blood clot," but there was no other significant family history.

The physical examination was significant for moderate pitting edema, mild erythema, and tenderness of the left leg from the foot up to the mid-calf area. The left calf circumference was 4 cm greater than the right calf, but there were no dilated superficial veins or palpable venous cords. The patient was able to bear weight on the affected leg but had an antalgic gait (a limp adopted to avoid pain on weight-bearing structures, characterized by a very short stance phase).

The patient had a normal radiograph of her left foot and ankle. The emergency medicine resident evaluating the patient was concerned about the possibility of a deep venous thrombosis and ordered a Doppler ultrasound examination of the left lower extremity. The preliminary radiology interpretation faxed to the ED read, "thrombus left distal superficial femoral vein." The emergency medicine resident and attending physician caring for this patient interpreted this result as representing a superficial vein thrombus. Knowing that superficial venous thromboses can usually be treated safely without anticoagulation (because of their very low risk of causing pulmonary embolism), they diagnosed the patient with cellulitis complicated by a superficial thrombophlebitis and prescribed oral antibiotics along with elevation and warm compresses to the affected leg.

The final report of the patient's ultrasound, which returned many hours later, read, "deep vein thrombosis of the left distal superficial femoral vein." This final interpretation was not communicated to the patient's caregivers. The resident followed up 2 days later on the final reading of the study and recognized that the new information meant that the patient should have been anticoagulated. The patient was contacted and asked to return to the ED for initiation of treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin. The patient returned promptly and was treated without any complications. She completed 3 months of therapy, and a follow-up ultrasound showed resolution of her deep vein thrombosis.

Title: Who Nose Where the Airway Is?

The Case:
A 70-year-old man with peripheral vascular disease was brought to the operating room to undergo vascular bypass surgery on his right upper extremity. Because the surgery was expected to involve only the arm, the case was started using local anesthesia. A certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) was present to monitor the patient and to provide intravenous medications for anxiety, sedation, and pain control (monitored anesthesia care [MAC]). The CRNA was supervised by an attending anesthesiologist (a physician) but, because the surgery was a straightforward procedure performed under local anesthesia with MAC, the anesthesiologist was not physically present and knew very little about the case.

During the procedure, the patient complained of generalized discomfort and anxiety, requiring increased doses of opiates and benzodiazepines (an anti-anxiety medication). With these medications, the patient became sleepy but remained arousable. To maintain a patent airway, the CRNA placed a nasopharyngeal airway, a soft plastic tube inserted into the nose that extends into the posterior pharynx (Figures). Normally, the tip of this tube remains outside the nose, where it can be seen by clinicians. After this insertion, the patient did well with normal respirations and oxygen saturations.

After 2 hours of surgery, the vascular surgeon decided that they would need to use a vein from the patient's legs to replace a blood vessel in his upper extremity. Because this was expected to be a long and relatively complicated procedure, the decision was made to switch the patient to generalized anesthesia, which would require endotracheal intubation (placement of a plastic tube through the mouth and down into the lungs) and mechanical ventilation. The CRNA contacted the supervising anesthesiologist to help convert the case to general anesthesia. Very little information was exchanged between the two clinicians, and the anesthesiologist intubated the patient without complication. The CRNA managed the anesthesia, and the remainder of the surgery was uneventful. The patient was successfully extubated and did well after the surgery.

The following day, the patient remained stable, and the physician team was planning on discharging him to home. Curiously, the patient complained to the team that although he was feeling well, when he tried to drink any liquid it would come right out of his nose. To overcome the skepticism of the surgical team, the patient took a gulp of his orange juice with the physicians present, and, sure enough, most of the juice flowed out of his nose onto his hospital gown. To the astonishment of the team, he repeated the scenario.

The surgeons decided to make the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and gave him fluids intravenously. They consulted otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat specialists) with concerns about a pharyngeal fistula or another anatomic abnormality—there were no obvious abnormalities seen extruding from the nose. The otolaryngologist discovered that the nasopharyngeal airway, which had been placed during the initial surgery, was still in his nose. It was not entirely clear how the tube had become lodged within the nasal cavity (so that its external portion was no longer extruding from the nose), but presumably this occurred when the patient was intubated by the anesthesiologist.

The plastic tube was removed, and the patient was discharged home later that day. He suffered no significant consequences from the event, but he did require an additional day in the hospital.

================================================================================

Title: Danger in Disruption

The Case:


A 23-month-old toddler was severely dehydrated after vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction. She had metabolic alkalosis (pH = 7.58), and her last peripheral IV site had been lost. The nurse caring for her that day was expert, had worked on that unit for years, and had helped write unit and hospital pediatric policies. One of these policies limited the number of IV sticks in children, so the nurse requested that anesthesiology attempt femoral access.

When the anesthesiologist arrived with an assistant, they took the patient to a treatment room for sedation before attempting to establish a femoral IV site. The nurse informed them that hospital policy prohibited sedation in the unit without monitoring. When her comments were ignored, she went to alert the charge nurse and obtain a copy of the policy.

In the meantime, propofol was administered without monitoring. Upon her return, the nurse observed that the child was apneic and again requested monitoring. The anesthesiologist replied that it wasn't necessary, applied a painful stimulus, and noted that spontaneous respiration resumed. He proceeded to prepare for the femoral stick, but the nurse noticed that he did not use sterile technique and he contaminated the needle. At this point, the nurse attempted to stop the procedure, and the verbal exchange became heated. The anesthesiologist threw the needle on the floor and walked toward the door. The nurse firmly requested that he stay and monitor the patient while she was still sedated.

The child was apneic briefly but recovered without incident. The anesthesiologist did eventually insert a peripheral IV and the re-hydration therapy resumed.

The situation was "saved" by the patient's nurse, who in the midst of a very difficult encounter with a physician, repeatedly made firm requests for adherence to policies designed for safety. Despite her many years of experience, this nurse was emotionally distressed by the event.

================================================================================

Title: Difficult Encounters: A CMO and CNO Respond

The Case:


An 89-year-old man was admitted to the orthopedic service after sustaining a hip fracture. The patient's family physician requested a cardiology evaluation. Surgery was delayed while the consultant evaluated the patient. The cardiologist identified severe aortic stenosis (echocardiogram showed an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2) and recommended that the patient not go to surgery. On the late afternoon following the cardiologist's report, the orthopedic resident called the operating room to schedule the patient for surgery later that evening. The nurse on the floor paged the orthopedic resident and read the cardiologist's conclusions and recommendations over the phone. The resident came to the floor, told the nurse that she was "stupid" and confidently explained that the case would be done under spinal anesthesia, so the cardiologist's concerns were nothing to worry about.

Spinal anesthesia can cause unexpected and sudden hypotension resulting in hypoperfusion of the coronary arteries and sudden death. At 7:00 PM, the nurse called the hospital's Chief Medical Officer (CMO), who was getting ready to leave for the day. The CMO promptly paged the orthopedic resident, who was meeting with the attending orthopedic surgeon to review x-rays of the case. The CMO went to the x-ray department and talked with two residents and the attending. The CMO patiently explained the risk of perioperative death associated with hypotension in the presence of severe aortic stenosis. The attending then called the operating room to cancel the case. The following day, the CMO reviewed the nurse's intervention with the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO).

Two days later, the patient suddenly arrested on the floor. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful.



================================================================================

Title: Is the Admission Drug Dose Too Low?

The Case:


A 72-year-old man with a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath. His admitting diagnoses were COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Among his preadmission medications, the patient was taking Theo-Dur (extended-release theophylline), 300 mg three times daily. A theophylline blood level, drawn on admission, was 1.2 mg/L (therapeutic range: 10-20 mg/L). The admitting physician ordered Theo-Dur, 600 mg TID. A nurse questioned the order since this was double the patient's usual dosage, but the physician stated that he needed to get the patient's blood level up. The patient received Theo-Dur, 600 mg, at 12:00 AM, 5:56 AM, 11:43 AM, and 11:00 PM.

A theophylline blood level, drawn at 3:22 AM the following day, was 28.7 mg/L. The lab called the "critical result" to the floor at 6:55 AM. The night-shift nurse, a recent hire, had not checked to see if the blood level result was back before giving the patient his next dose of Theo-Dur at 6:05 AM. Later that day, the patient developed atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response (heart rate in the range of 140 bpm), chest pain, and increased shortness of breath. A repeat theophylline blood level, drawn at 7:08 PM, was 38.1 mg/L, a very dangerous level. The patient was given oral activated charcoal, intravenous digoxin, and a continuous infusion of diltiazem. The patient's heart rate remained elevated for 3 days but ultimately returned to normal.



================================================================================

Title: Hiding in Plain Sight

The Case:


A 65-year-old woman presented to an emergency department (ED) with 48 hours of nontraumatic left lower back pain and general malaise. She was diagnosed with a musculoskeletal injury and discharged from the ED with muscle relaxants and antiinflammatory medications. She returned to the ED the following day with increased back pain described as shooting and burning in nature. Physical examination was reported as unremarkable, and basic laboratory tests and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) study came up normal as well. The patient was unable to ambulate due to pain and developed nausea related to her narcotic therapy. She was later admitted for observation and additional analgesics. The admitting hospitalist evaluated the patient and started her on intravenous analgesics. He did not document any evidence of neurologic deficits or an acute abdomen.

The next morning, the hospitalist assuming care for the patient readily noted a vesicular rash in the exact distribution of her pain symptoms and correctly diagnosed a herpes zoster infection (shingles). The patient was treated with prednisone and acyclovir and was discharged with improved symptoms. The patient initially reported the rash more than 24 hours prior to her hospitalization but didn't think it was related to her pain. She stated, "Nobody actually looked at my skin until the following morning." The patient had a full recovery but likely underwent unnecessary testing and delays to appropriate, disease-specific treatment.

================================================================================

Title: Missing Trauma

The Case:


A 54-year-old woman collapsed behind the counter of a small neighborhood market. She was discovered a few minutes later by a customer, who immediately called 911. On arrival, paramedics found the patient unresponsive, with poor respiratory effort and a barely palpable pulse. Initial treatment included fluid resuscitation and external pacing for a heart rate in the 40s. The patient was transported to the nearest emergency department (ED), where an initial chest x-ray suggested congestive heart failure. Rather acutely, the patient became pulseless, and CPR was initiated as the patient's cardiac rhythm went from bradycardia to ventricular fibrillation, and then asystole. The patient was pronounced dead after an hour of failed resuscitative efforts.

The transporting paramedics later returned to the ED, which, of note, was not a trauma center. The ED physician informed the paramedic team of the patient's death and reported that the patient had a tiny amount of blood on her left nipple, which he attributed to chest compressions. Together, the paramedics and the ED physician examined the patient's clothing and discovered a drop of blood inside her bra and a small hole in the bra itself. Further review of the admitting chest x-ray indicated the presence of a small caliber bullet in the area of the left ventricle, which was initially thought to be a cardiac monitoring electrode. The medical examiner was notified of the possible homicide, and an autopsy confirmed that a bullet likely lacerated the patient's left ventricle.



================================================================================

Title: Vial Mistakes Involving Heparin

The Case:


A 65-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for an elective left carotid endarterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon requested 5000 units of intravenous (IV) heparin prior to clamping the carotid artery. The anesthesiologist administered 5 mL of heparin from what he believed was a 1000 units/mL concentration vial. After 3 minutes, an activated clotting time (ACT) was drawn while the surgeon clamped the carotid artery and proceeded with the surgery. When the ACT returned normal rather than prolonged (as it should have been after the heparin), the anesthesiologist repeated the ACT to confirm the result.

The anesthesiologist then re-dosed and administered what he thought was 7000 units of heparin as the surgeon grew concerned about the cross clamp time without adequate anticoagulation. When a repeat ACT once again returned normal, the anesthesiologist requested a new batch of heparin vials while reaching into the garbage and picking up the vial from which he had drawn. He quickly realized that the heparin vial from thegarbagewas a 10 units/mL concentration rather than a 1000 units/mL as intended. The two vials of heparin were designed to be color differentiated with different shades of yellow, and the anesthesiologist had chosen the wrong one from the cart. Another dose was administered from the correct vial, and the patient's ACT time rapidly became appropriately therapeutic. Luckily, the prolonged clamp time without anticoagulation led to no obvious clinical harm, making this a serious "near miss" event.

================================================================================

Title: EMR Entry Error: Not So Benign

The Case:
A 47-year-old man with advanced AIDS was admitted to an academic medical center with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He was diagnosed withPneumocystis jirovecipneumonia (PCP) and started on appropriate antibiotic therapy. On physical examination, in addition to abnormal pulmonary findings, the patient had multiple flat purple skin lesions on his left thigh and several perianal lesions. Given his advanced AIDS, the medical team was concerned about Kaposi's sarcoma and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, respectively. The dermatology service was consulted, and they performed biopsies of both lesions.

The patient continued to receive treatment forPCPand was slowly improving. Three days later, the intern on the team was reviewing the patient's clinical information in the hospital's electronic medical record (EMR). She looked up the biopsy results and discovered that the left thigh lesion was Kaposi's sarcoma and the perianal biopsy showed squamous cell carcinomain situ. Interestingly, there was a third biopsy result in the electronic record, labeled "right neck" and reported as "basal cell carcinoma." The intern didn't recall any neck lesions (or discussion of a third biopsy), but questioned her memory as it had been a busy call night. She noted the results and went to see other patients.

The patient's primary care doctor (who was not directly caring for the patient in the hospital) visited the patient and looked at the medical record before seeing him. He noted thePCPdiagnosis, a low CD4 count, and biopsy evidence of three separate cancers. Given the patient's end-stage AIDS and these new diagnoses, the primary care doctor met with the patient and recommended hospice care. He told the patient that, with "cancer in three places," his overall prognosis was poor.

That afternoon, the inpatient medical team recognized the error—the neck biopsy had been performed on another patient and accidentally entered into this patient's medical record. The team and the primary care doctor all met with the patient to disclose the mistake, but clearly the error had caused the patient tremendous pain and mental anguish.

On further investigation, it became clear that the dermatopathology department was unaware of the error. Their department used a standalone software program to track and report biopsy results, a system whose results were electronically "dumped" into the hospital's EMR. But the department physicians and staff didn't have access to the hospital's EMR. In fact, when called and asked if they had seen the error in X (the name of the EMR), the pathologist responded, "What is X?" Eventually, it was determined that the third, incorrect biopsy result had been entered into the pathology software under the wrong patient identifier and then uploaded into the hospital's EMR.

================================================================================

Title: Eptifibatide Epilogue

The Case:


A 62-year-old man was admitted at 11:00 PM on a Saturday night with the provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Serial testing for markers of cardiac injury was begun, and he was treated with a beta-blocker, enoxaparin, and a statin. At 6:00 AM Sunday, the patient's troponin was elevated and the diagnosis was upgraded to NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction). The intern entered an order for intravenous eptifibatide (a powerful anticlotting agent given by intravenous drip) into the computerized order entry system in anticipation of expedited coronary intervention on Monday morning. The intern entered the correct weight-based dosage of eptifibatide (a loading dose, followed by a maintenance infusion of 2 µg/kg/min) into the order template. Because of a forcing function in the template, he also had to enter a maintenance infusion rate in milliliters per hour (mL/hr). He was unsure of the proper infusion rate, so he arbitrarily chose 0.5 mL/hr. He expected the pharmacist on duty to make adjustments to the order as needed.

The eptifibatide order was electronically transferred to the pharmacy for processing. The pharmacist processed the order as entered, and eptifibatide was sent to the floor for administration. The nurse on duty was harried because he was caring for six patients instead of the usual four. He correctly administered the loading dose and ran the maintenance infusion at 0.5 mL/hr, under-dosing the patient by a factor of 40. The night shift nurse continued the infusion at this rate, as did the nurse on the following day shift. The day shift nurse was curious about the low dose and queried the intern, but the nurse was distracted by her additional charge nurse duties. The patient was taken to the percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) lab at 2:00 PM on Monday, by which time his troponin values had peaked and were trending down. In the PCI lab, the eptifibatide infusion error was immediately noted. The patient subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty with stenting. It is impossible to say whether the underdose of the blood thinner led to more cardiac damage.

================================================================================

Title: Breakage of a PICC Line

The Case:
Born at 27 weeks' gestation, a premature infant had a standard, silastic, 1.9 F percutaneously inserted central venous catheter (PICC) placed on day two of life for parenteral nutrition. The PICC was inserted under sterile conditions with placement verified by X-ray. Initially, the infant was on ventilator support and NPO due to feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis surveillance. Several attempts were made to introduce feeds; however, the infant continued to have large residuals and increased abdominal girth.

After 40 days of parenteral therapy, the antecubital site and the upper arm became red, swollen, and tender to the touch. The neonatologist opted to remove the catheter. When the RN started to remove the PICC, it broke, leaving approximately 7 cm in the patient.

After several attempts to retrieve the remainder of the line, with X-rays to check placement, the infant was sent for surgical removal of the catheter. Cultures taken via blood and PICC reported moderate growth ofStaphylococcus. The infant required an increased level of care that included ventilator support, infusion of blood products, and antibiotic treatment.



================================================================================

Title: Double Dosing, by the Rules

The Case:
A 65-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was admitted to a medical unit during the night with worsening shortness of breath. Orders were written at 2:00 AM for prednisone 60 mg daily and for continued administration of her daily methadone dose of 80 mg. The medications were administered by the night-shift nurse when they arrived on the unit at 6:00 AM, in accordance with a new policy that specified that all newly ordered medications be administered to patients within 4 hours.

The nurse assigned to this patient for the day shift also administered the two medications at 9:00 AM to comply with another policy regulating daily medication administration. When the day-shift nurse documented his administration of the two medications, he realized that the same medications had been administered 3 hours earlier. He immediately notified the physician, and continuous pulse oximetry and hourly vital sign checks were conducted to watch for oversedation from the methadone overdose. Fortunately, the patient was able to tolerate the extra doses of prednisone and methadone with no lasting effects.

This incident illustrates how multiple reasonable system policies can produce an unreasonable result. The policy mandating that all new medications be given within 4 hours of being ordered had just been implemented a few days before the incident, while the policy of administering all daily medications between 8:00 and 10:00 AM had been rigorously enforced for many years. Both were policies designed to enhance effectiveness and safety but, applied together, introduced a threat to patient safety.

================================================================================

Title: Medication Reconciliation Victory After an Avoidable Error

The Case:


A 91-year-old woman, previously active and independent, recently developed weight loss, confusion, and falls without injury. She lived alone. Late one night, her family visited and found her on the floor of her home. She was lethargic and incontinent, and her speech was slurred. She did not appear to recognize her family members. She was taken to the hospital and admitted for altered mental status and dehydration. Upon arrival to the ward, the admitting nurse attempted to reconcile her home medications with those ordered on admission. However, the patient was unable to tell the nurse which medications she was taking. A family member was asked to return to the patient's home, gather all of her medications, and bring them to the hospital so that medication reconciliation could be performed. In all, seven prescription medications were returned, including Flexeril 10 mg TID, glipizide 10 mg daily, Neurontin 200 mg TID, lisinopril 10 mg daily, gabapentin 200 mg TID, cyclobenzaprine 10 mg TID, and Lortab 5 mg as needed for pain. Some medications had been filled at a local pharmacy, while others were filled by a mail-order pharmacy. The admitting physician recognized that several of the medications were duplicates (Flexeril is the brand name of cyclobenzaprine; Neurontin the brand name of gabapentin), and he adjusted the medication regimen accordingly.

The day after admission, the patient was more alert and responsive to questions. Her medications were reviewed, and she reported that she was taking all of the medications, as prescribed, from the bottles that were retrieved from her home. Unaware that any of the medications were duplicates, she thought she was taking exactly what her physician had intended.

================================================================================

Title: Hospital Admission Due to High-Dose Methotrexate Drug Interaction

The Case:


A 40-year-old woman with osteosarcoma in her left leg received neoadjuvant high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MAP) prior to left leg resection and reconstruction. She continued to receive MAP in the outpatient oncology center after surgery. Four months after leg reconstruction, the patient developed left lower extremity erythema and was admitted to the plastic surgery service for presumed cellulitis. The wound was debrided, and the patient received antibiotic therapy. Four days after admission, she was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of intravenous vancomycin and oral ciprofloxacin.

On the 10th day of antibiotics, she went to the outpatient oncology center for high-dose methotrexate in accordance with the MAP cycle. She returned the following day to the oncology center for routine leucovorin "rescue" and IV hydration. She reported extreme fatigue and was found to have transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 668 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 822 IU/L) in the presence of an elevated methotrexate blood level. After her readmission to the hospital for leucovorin rescue and aggressive hydration, she received a diagnosis of methotrexate toxicity due to a presumed interaction with ciprofloxacin.

================================================================================

Title: Are Two Insulin Pumps Better Than One?

The Case:


A 62-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. His diabetes had been managed with an insulin pump while he was an outpatient. During his preparation for surgery, the patient asked the staff to leave his insulin pump in place and running at a basal rate. After surgery, he was transferred to the coronary care unit where orders were written to start him on a standard intravenous insulin infusion protocol. After he was extubated, the patient asked the nurse for his hourly finger stick blood glucose results. Unbeknownst to the nurse, the patient would then adjust his insulin pump in response to the glucose readings. At the same time, the nurse adjusted the intravenous insulin infusion rate based on the standardized protocol. The patient's blood glucose levels fluctuated, and he experienced hypoglycemia (with blood glucose levels in the range of 50-60 mg/dL) on several occasions. When the nurse mentioned the insulin pump at case management rounds, the medical director inquired further and, after discussion with the patient, the double dosing was discovered. The patient then agreed to turn off his insulin pump while he was receiving the intravenous insulin infusion.

================================================================================

Title: To Transfer or Not to Transfer

The Case:
A 74-year-old man had a long history of coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass grafting as well as placement of an automated internal cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) for ventricular arrhythmias. His AICD was almost 10 years old, and his cardiologist had found minor lead displacement (one of the wires to his heart had moved over time). Admitted to Hospital X (less than 1 mile from his house), he underwent the placement of a new AICD—a minor surgical procedure, which was uncomplicated. The patient was discharged 2 days later.

Within hours after arriving home from the hospital, the patient's newly placed AICD began "firing"—shocking his heart with large amounts of energy and causing considerable pain. As the AICD fired more than 15 times in the course of minutes, his wife called 911.

Emergency medical services (EMS) arrived and found him lying on the couch, awake and alert, but in discomfort. His heart rate and blood pressure were normal. Because of repeated AICD firings and concern for a heart attack, he was taken in the ambulance.

The patient told paramedics that he had received all of his care at Hospital X and had just been discharged from there. However, they took him to Hospital Y, a few miles away.

In the emergency department (ED) of Hospital Y, the patient's AICD continued to fire shocks. The defibrillation stopped after the patient was treated with amiodarone and supportive care. He was then admitted to cardiology at Hospital Y for ongoing management. The next day, when the patient was clinically stable, the cardiologist considered transferring him back to Hospital X but decided to keep him at Hospital Y.

Unfortunately, the patient continued to have more ventricular arrhythmias and firings of his AICD even with medical treatment. Despite maximal efforts, the patient eventually died from a cardiac arrest.

It was unclear whether the patient's death could have been prevented had he been taken to Hospital X. However, one could argue that he may have received better informed care had he been admitted to his original hospital.



================================================================================

Title: Sick and Pregnant

The Case:


A 35-year-old woman with chronic asthma presented to the emergency department (ED) with difficulty breathing. The patient informed the staff that she was 17 weeks pregnant and had an obstetrician on staff at another hospital. A urine pregnancy test was ordered and was positive. The test result was documented in the electronic medical record. The patient was treated with inhaled bronchodilators, but her respiratory distress persisted. The ED physician contacted the on-call internist to admit the patient for continued therapy. The internist agreed to admit the patient, but he was not told that the patient was pregnant. The admitting nurse received a report from the ED nurse, but again, the patient's pregnancy status was not mentioned.

On admission, the patient was ordered to receive intravenous corticosteroids, nebulized bronchodilators, and intravenous levofloxacin (a pregnancy category C antibiotic [see Table]). In the morning, the internist saw the patient. She informed him that she was pregnant. The physician reviewed the patient's medication administration record and determined that she received one dose of levofloxacin. He discontinued levofloxacin and ordered an alternate antibiotic that was pregnancy category B. A maternal-fetal specialist was consulted and reported that one dose of levofloxacin should have no adverse effects on the fetus.

================================================================================

Title: A Mid-Summer Fog

The Case:


A 33-year-old woman with type I diabetes mellitus was admitted for symptoms of left flank pain, dysuria, and emesis, concerning for pyelonephritis. The patient was taking 40 units of Lantus daily and 10 units of NovoLog with meals and reported good glycemic control on this regimen. On exam, she was febrile but with otherwise normal vital signs, and her laboratory studies were notable for a leukocytosis and glucose of 275. A computed tomography (CT) study confirmed pyelonephritis but also showed marked left-sided hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Urology recommended that the patient be kept NPO overnight in case a procedure was required the following morning. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and intravenous fluids while the new intern, working on his first call night in July at a new hospital, thumbed through the different insulin order forms.

The intern came from a hospital system (as a medical student) that relied entirely on paper orders. This particular hospital used different insulin order forms depending on whether the patient was insulin-dependent, eating, or NPO. The confused intern chose the wrong form, causing the patient to receive insulin in doses that failed to account for her NPO status. At 6:00 the following morning, the intern was called when the patient became unresponsive with a glucose level of 32. The patient responded quickly to treatment with D50 and had a full recovery once the error in insulin order forms was discovered around the hypoglycemic event.



================================================================================

Title: Dangerous Shift

The Case:




A 3-month-old infant was admitted with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection to a pediatric medical unit. Although she was initially stable (without oxygen requirements), her breathing soon became labored, with an increased respiratory rate and subcostal retractions. Providers determined that she would benefit from a higher level of care and initiated the transfer process. This transfer happened to coincide with a shift change for both the nursing staff and the physicians involved.

The off-going nurse assumed that the transfer would take place immediately and signed out her patients to the next nurse before the patient was physically moved. The outgoing physician sent a text page to his incoming colleague with similar sign-out. Approximately 45 minutes later, the unit clerk called the infant's bedside nurse to report that the infant's parents believed their child was in significant distress. The nurse was surprised that the patient had not yet been transferred and, after an initial evaluation, immediately called the rapid response team. The evening physician was also contacted and was equally surprised by the series of events. She had been told that the patient was being transferred "non-emergently" to a unit for closer observation. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she made a full recovery, after a prolonged hospitalization.

The hospital performance improvement committee reviewed the case and determined that improper delegation and lack of communication between staff members contributed to the delay in treatment, and that improved policies should be required for shift changes.



================================================================================

Title: Mistaken Identity

The Case:
An 85-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman was admitted to the medical service with altered mental status and a reported fall. After finding tenderness in her left hip, the physicians obtained plain films, which confirmed a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was consulted and, after evaluating the patient, decided that the patient's age, comorbidities, and minimal pain and tenderness on exam made her a candidate for conservative, nonsurgical treatment. These recommendations were documented in her electronic health record, where the team specifically noted: "We're reassured to see the patient is able to weight-bear without pain, even though we wouldn't suggest it in the short-term."

The following day, one of the medical interns read the orthopedic surgeon's note and found these comments about the patient ambulating odd. The patient had strict bed-rest orders and was in significant pain, making it hard to believe that she had been observed walking. After further investigation, the intern realized that the orthopedic team had evaluated the wrong patient—the patient's roommate, who also happened to be a Cantonese-speaking elderly woman. The orthopedic surgery team was consulted again and, after some embarrassment about their mistake, offered surgical repair of the correct patient's fractured hip.

Title: Coming Up Short

The Case:


A 12-year-old Hispanic female was seen for a well-child check. The child was delivered 2 months prematurely (likely due to domestic violence) in Puerto Rico. She had an intracerebral hemorrhage and was in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for 6 months. The child moved to the United States with her family 5 years ago. The child is currently 22.7 kg and 107 cm (very small according to the growth chart [Figure] for her age), with a normal-sized head. The patient's mother, who speaks only Spanish, says the child developed and grew normally until age 7, when she stopped growing and began to lose ground developmentally. A few years ago, a school evaluation found that she was mentally retarded.

At the time of the present evaluation, the mother stated that the child had been seen twice in a family practice office for "well checks" over the past few years but had not had blood tests or a thorough evaluation for her growth and developmental problems. On this visit, the family physician ordered routine labs and referred her to pediatric endocrinology. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test result was 834 (a near record high), and she was diagnosed as likely having Hashimoto's disease. Thyroglobulin antibodies of 701 and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies of 576 confirmed this diagnosis. The patient has since begun thyroid replacement therapy and is likely to grow and develop with thyroid replacement. However, according to the endocrinologist, the child's mental function is unlikely to recover.



================================================================================

Title: Where's the Feeding Tube?

The Case:


A 13-year-old boy was involved in a motor vehicle collision and experienced a traumatic brain injury. Because of the injuries, he was unable to swallow and had to receive nutrition through a nasojejunal feeding tube. After many weeks in the intensive care unit (ICU), he was transferred to a rehabilitation unit with improved mental status. A routine chest radiograph performed to check for resolution of a pneumothorax (punctured lung) revealed that the nasojejunal tube had migrated, and the tip was now in the gastric area (serving as a nasogastric feeding tube). The medical team felt that this placement was adequate, and the boy continued to receive enteral feedings.

Two days later, the boy developed tachycardia (increased heart rate), tachypnea (increased respiratory rate), and decreased oxygen levels that required supplemental oxygen. A portable chest radiograph revealed evidence of pneumonia. In addition, the chest radiograph showed the nasogastric tube had moved again, and the tip was now in the esophagus. Given the more proximal location of the nasogastric tube, physicians felt that the pneumonia was most likely from an aspiration event (inhalation of the liquid food into the lungs).

Because of decreasing oxygen levels and worsening mental status, the patient required transfer back to the ICU. He was treated with antibiotics and supportive care and slowly improved. He returned to the rehabilitation center 3 days later, but unfortunately his mental status and physical state had declined since before the aspiration event. His recovery was delayed, and the aspiration event caused significant emotional distress for his family.

================================================================================

Title: Failure to Latch

The Case:


The patient is a full-term, 8.5-pound, healthy infant whose parents were strongly committed to breastfeeding exclusively for 6 months. However, early breastfeeding did not go smoothly. The newborn suckled frequently and strongly but did not appear to be receiving adequate intake. The infant had marginal output characterized by decreased urinary output, and the mother experienced painful bleeding nipples. While not specifically trained to assist with breastfeeding, nurses in the postpartum unit offered assistance but ultimately suggested formula supplementation, which the parents refused. Mother and infant were discharged 48 hours after delivery.

Because of the low output and rising bilirubin, the infant was seen by a pediatrician three times in the next 6 days and experienced a 15% weight loss. The infant's output continued to be marginal. The infant was nursing frequently for 30–45 minutes at a time, was quite fussy, and tended to fall asleep at the breast. The mother reported that her breasts were tender and the nipples were painful but no longer bleeding. The pediatrician evaluated the infant for hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin increased to 16 mg/L) but did not observe the infant feeding. The pediatrician suggested that the parents give the infant formula supplementation before every feeding.

The worried and exhausted parents, bewildered by conflicting advice, eventually sought telephone advice from a lactation consultant, who recommended a plan of pumping, nursing, and formula supplementation after feeding. Following this regimen, the infant gained 4 ounces in 4 days and the total serum bilirubin decreased to 11. Breastfeeding continued to be difficult, and the parents scheduled a face-to-face visit with the lactation consultant. The consultant observed a feeding and performed a physical examination, after which she identified the infant as having ankyloglossia (tongue-tie).

================================================================================

Title: What Was in Those Platelets?

The Case:


A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for complex spinal surgery. The surgery went well without complications, and postoperatively she was transferred to a general surgical ward. Shortly thereafter, she spiked a fever, became tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic, and developed a red rash across her chest. She was reintubated (placed back on the mechanical ventilator), given an infusion of dopamine to maintain adequate blood pressure, and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). She was found to have severe septic shock and developed multiorgan system failure. On initial evaluation, the clinicians were puzzled and confused because there was no clear cause for her septic shock.

On the same day, a 76-year-old man with coronary artery disease and a prosthetic aortic valve was admitted for spinal surgery. The procedure went well, and he was stable and transferred to a general surgical ward postoperatively. Later that evening, he developed tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia, requiring reintubation and transfer to the ICU. He was found to have sepsis and, despite extensive diagnostic testing, the clinical team could not identify a clear cause for his decompensation.

Given the similarity in clinical course, the hospital investigated the two cases. Upon detailed review, the blood bank discovered that both patients had received intraoperative platelet transfusions from the same batch of platelets. With further testing, it was determined that the entire batch of platelets was contaminated withStaphylococcus aureus, a virulent and aggressive bacteria often found in hospitals.

The 47-year-old woman remained critically ill for many days and hadStaphylococcus aureusin her bloodstream for more than a week despite antibiotic therapy. She had a long and complicated hospitalization, but she was ultimately discharged in stable condition. The bacterium was never cultured from the blood of the 76-year-old man, but he remained febrile in the ICU for many days. Given his prosthetic valve, an echocardiogram was obtained that showed possible bacterial endocarditis (infection of his heart valve with the bacteria). In addition to a prolonged hospitalization, he required 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics as a result of the contaminated platelet transfusion.

================================================================================

Title: Wrong Route for Nutrients

The Case:


An 82-year-old man living in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) had not been eating or drinking well for about 6 months. He had lost weight and developed several decubitus ulcers on his coccyx and hips that were not healing. He was diagnosed with failure to thrive and was fed using a percutaneous enterostomy tube. This treatment did not bring about improvement in his condition. To provide more nutrition, the physician placed a central venous line and prescribed intravenous (IV) total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administration.

In the SNF, licensed practical nurses (LPNs) administer most medications. The LPN on the night shift mistakenly hooked up the total nutrient fluid prepared for the central line (i.e., to be delivered as IV TPN) to the enterostomy tube. The patient's daughter was in the room and observed this error. She questioned the LPN about this procedure, and the LPN told her that this was what had been ordered. But just to be sure, the LPN checked with the registered nurse (RN) in charge and learned that the daughter's concern was well founded—indeed this total nutrient fluid was to be administered through the central line, not through the enterostomy tube.

Recognizing the mistake, the LPN returned to the patient's bedside to correct the error, disconnected the total nutrient line from the enterostomy tube, and prepared to connect it to the central line catheter. Fortunately, both the daughter (a retired RN) and the RN in charge were present and stopped the LPN from contaminating the central line with this line that had been directly communicating with the patient's bowel. The total nutrient solution was discarded, and the physician was notified. The next total nutrient fluid preparation did not arrive until the following evening. Therefore, the patient did not receive this supplemental nutrition for 24 hours.

================================================================================

Title: Is It Safe to Be Direct?

The Case:


A 92-year-old man with hypertension and heart failure (HF) was evaluated by his primary care physician (PCP) for progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. An electrocardiogram (EKG) in the office showed no acute evidence of ischemia, and the patient's vital signs were normal, including pulse oximetry. Given a suspected HF exacerbation, the PCP arranged for a direct admission to the hospital and contacted the hospitalist on call to report the clinical history. The patient was sent to the admitting office to await an available bed, thus avoiding a prolonged emergency department (ED) stay.

Three hours later, a bed opened and the patient was taken to the floor. His vital signs now demonstrated significant instability, with a heart rate of 144 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30, and pulse oximetry of 90% on room air. The admitting hospitalist was notified, the rapid response team was activated, and the patient received treatment for tachyarrhythmia and hypoxia. The patient's condition rapidly stabilized, and, after 3 days of treatment for his fluid overload and adjustments to his diuretic regimen, he returned home safely. The case prompted the hospital to consider the safety of admitting patients directly from outpatient clinics.

================================================================================

Title: The Inside of a Time Out

The Case:


A 65-year-old man was scheduled for an elective endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient had an allergy to "IV contrast dye" that was noted during his preoperative clinic visit with an anesthesiologist. The surgical physician assistant (PA) documented in a preoperative note that hydrocortisone should be used before surgery, but no such order was written. On the day of surgery, a different anesthesiologist expressed concern about the reported allergy and planned to discuss with the surgeon—mostly to understand the nature and severity of the allergy. Fighting time pressures, driven at least in part by a new policy that tracks and reports delays into the operating room (OR), the anesthesiologist and his resident induced general anesthesia, and the resident remained in the room as the attending left the OR to address an issue regarding another patient.

In the OR, the patient was surrounded by an attending surgeon, two surgical residents (but not the PA), two medical students, nursing staff, and a surgical device sales representative. A "time out" was conducted, during which a nurse raised concern about the alleged allergy. Everyone else in the room looked to the anesthesia resident for input. The resident, probably intimidated by the situation he found himself in, haltingly began to discuss the allergy, but the surgeons in attendance quickly came to a "consensus" to administer hydrocortisone and proceed. The anesthesiology attending returned to the room, upset not to be included in the time out. He felt that his resident didn't speak up to adequately address the allergy concern, in part because of the atmosphere in the OR. While the patient did well during the surgery, with no evident allergic reaction, the experience raised concerns about whether time out procedures were serving their intended role.

================================================================================

Title: The Wrongful Resuscitation

The Case:


An 80-year-old man with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, bilateral below-the-knee amputations, and poor quality of life had previously been resuscitated from sudden death. After his recovery, he completed a DNR (do not resuscitate) form signifying his desire to avoid such treatment in the future.

The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) in extreme pain and was found to have a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although his DNR form was with him, neither the ED staff nor the consulting surgeon looked at it. The patient was rushed to the operating room (OR), where his AAA was repaired. Postoperatively, an internist came upon the DNR form in the patient's chart and discussed resuscitation preferences with the patient and the family. The patient reconfirmed his desire to avoid resuscitation and heroic procedures, expressing anger that he had been taken to the OR for the AAA repair. The family agreed with the patient's choice. The internist wrote a DNR order in the chart, but the surgeon—having just completed major surgery on this patient—was furious, changing the code status back to "full code." Ultimately, the internist consulted with the hospital ethicist, who convinced the surgeon to honor the patient's and family's wishes. The DNR order was reinstated, and the patient later died of a cardiac arrest during the hospitalization.

================================================================================

Title: The Forgotten Drip

The Case:
A 45-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by his friends because of a 1-day history of a severe headache and "bizarre behavior." A computed tomography (CT) scan of his brain revealed acute intracranial hemorrhage with cerebral edema, evidence of midline shift, and increased intracranial pressure(Figure). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Multiple therapies were initiated to reduce the intracranial pressure and swelling, including intubation and mechanical ventilation, intravenous steroids, and an infusion of mannitol. In addition, intravenous fluids were withheld, to prevent worsening of the cerebral edema. Over the next 24 hours, the patient showed minimal improvement and remained unresponsive and comatose. Repeat CT scanning showed a stable hemorrhage but persistent cerebral edema.

On hospital day 2, another CT scan showed that the hemorrhage was unchanged, but there was significant improvement in the cerebral edema. Based on these results, the physicians expected the patient's mental status to be improved; however, he remained in a coma. A review of that day's laboratory data revealed that the patient had developed severe hypernatremia (high enough to explain his continued altered mental status) and new acute renal failure since admission. Nephrology was consulted to help determine the etiology of the hypernatremia and renal failure and to make recommendations about management.

In reviewing the records, consultants realized that the mannitol infusion had been continued for more than 24 hours at a very high dose. The mannitol, as expected, had induced a profound osmotic diuresis. Because the patient had not received any additional intravenous or enteral fluids, he had become severely dehydrated. Although the hemorrhage and cerebral edema were improved, the patient remained unresponsive and comatose because of the hypernatremia and acute renal failure. He had a prolonged hospitalization and ultimately died from complications related to renal failure.

================================================================================

Title: Overdose on Oxygen?

The Case:
An 84-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen (1–2 L/min) presented to the emergency department with cough, chills, and shortness of breath. On physical examination, she was afebrile and tachypneic, and her oxygen saturation was 94% on 2 L of oxygen. Her pulmonary examination was unremarkable. The chest radiograph revealed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. She was given appropriate therapies and, with her mild illness, was expected to be discharged the following day.

On the morning following admission, she was found to be somnolent and minimally arousable. She remained afebrile with a normal blood pressure and pulse, and the remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. The physician on duty noted that her oxygen saturation was 98% and she was receiving oxygen by nasal cannula at a rate of 4 L/min. An arterial blood gas was performed, which showed a pH of 7.21 (normal, 7.35–7.45) with a partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) of 101 mm Hg (normal, 35–45 mm Hg) and an oxygen of 85 mm Hg. The hypercarbia (increased CO2) was felt to be due to excessive oxygen administration and likely explained her change in mental status.

She was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she failed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and required endotracheal intubation. Her oxygen "dose" was lowered, in an effort to keep her saturation in the 90%–94% range. With that (and treatment of her infection and COPD), her hypercarbia promptly resolved. She was extubated the following day, had an uncomplicated subsequent hospital course, and was discharged home 3 days later.

================================================================================

Title: Hold That Order

The Case:
A 25-year-old woman with a history of a pituitary tumor was admitted with hypernatremia. Because of her previous pituitary resection and radiation, the patient had a long history of central diabetes insipidus and difficult to manage sodium homeostasis. At home, she balanced administration of DDAVP (desmopressin acetate) and free-water boluses given by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to maintain a normal sodium level. Due to PEG tube dysfunction, the patient was unable to give herself free-water boluses for the 2 days prior to admission and became progressively lethargic. On admission, her serum sodium level was 159 mEq/L.

During the patient's hospitalization, the house staff team struggled with her sodium management, trying to balance the DDAVP and the free water by PEG tube. On hospital day 3, although the patient was clinically stable, she had a serum sodium level of 131 mEq/L in the afternoon. Based on this result, the intern did not want her to get additional DDAVP that day, as it would lower the sodium level further. The intern wrote the following order: "Hold DDAVP tonight."

At this academic center, a medical center policy stated that all orders to "hold" medications are interpreted as "discontinue" orders. Thus, the medication was discontinued in the medication administration record (MAR) and in the pharmacy records. The intern was not notified of the discontinuation of the DDAVP.

The next day, the patient's sodium level slowly rose to 144 mEq/L in the afternoon, and the team wanted the patient to receive her evening DDAVP. The intern assumed that the patient would receive the evening dose of medication because her order had stated to hold it for only 1 day.

The patient was not given the DDAVP, and the following morning her sodium level was 154 mEq/L. She was slightly lethargic and less interactive than usual and was given an urgent dose of DDAVP. Her sodium level was closely monitored for the next 24 hours. She did not experience any serious or long-term consequences.

================================================================================

Title: Chemotherapy Extravasation

The Case:
A 73-year-old woman with no past medical history was diagnosed with stage IIIA breast cancer. She and her oncologist decided to begin systemic chemotherapy that would involve 6 cycles of treatment, all administered at the outpatient chemotherapy center located at the local hospital.

The patient arrived for her first day of treatment. A nurse who was relatively new to the job had difficulty placing a peripheral IV catheter but was ultimately able to achieve venous access in the left arm. Despite meeting some resistance when infusing saline, the nurse proceeded to infuse the first medication, doxorubicin, a highly toxic chemotherapeutic agent. The patient immediately began complaining of pain at the infusion site. Upon closer examination, the nurse noted that the chemotherapy had infused outside of the vein (extravasated) into the skin.

The nurse removed the IV catheter and placed an ice pack on the site. She had not been given any information about how to manage extravasations nor had she been informed of the location of the "extravasation kit," so she did not know what else needed to be done. Eventually, the IV site was bandaged and the patient was sent home to return later in the week. The patient suffered pain at the site with some mild redness and blistering but had no long-term side effects.

================================================================================

Title: Contaminated or Not? Guidelines for Interpretation of Positive Blood Cultures

The Case:
A 62-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and a history of ventricular tachycardia with an automated implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) came to his primary care physician (PCP) with symptoms of shaking, weakness, and vomiting. He denied fevers. The physical examination was unremarkable except for the presence of chronic peripheral neuropathy. The physician ordered routine blood tests and 2 peripheral blood cultures, diagnosed the patient with a nonspecific viral syndrome, and sent him home.

The routine laboratory tests done that day revealed only a normocytic anemia. However, 5 days later, the PCP was notified that both sets of blood cultures were growingCorynebacteriumspp. Uncertain of how to interpret the result (as this bacteria may represent contaminated blood cultures rather than a true cause of disease), the PCP contacted an infectious disease specialist, who recommended hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized, seen by a different infectious disease specialist, and started on IV antibiotics. The patient's subsequent evaluation revealed no evidence of infection, including an unremarkable abdominal CT scan and a normal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Repeat blood cultures (drawn before antibiotics were begun) remained negative. The patient was clinically stable, so the antibiotics were stopped and the patient was discharged to home. The physicians assumed that theCorynebacteriumwas a contaminant from the skin.

One month later, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea and vomiting. His physical examination and laboratory test results were unremarkable. His symptoms improved with IV fluids, and he was discharged after an 18-hour stay.

Two days later, 2 out of 2 blood cultures drawn at that ED visit started growingCorynebacteriumspp. That evening, the results were reported to a covering physician who was unfamiliar with the patient or previous culture results. The physician assumed that the blood cultures were contaminated from the skin and took no action.

Three weeks later, the patient was readmitted after being shocked by his defibrillator (AICD). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a tricuspid vegetation and blood cultures again showedCorynebacteriumspp. (the final speciation was never determined). Diagnosed with subacute bacterial endocarditis and treated with IV vancomycin, the patient made a full recovery.

================================================================================

Title: Too Hot For Comfort

The Case:
A 4-month-old infant admitted to rule out sepsis was receiving maintenance intravenous (IV) fluid and IV antibiotics via a peripheral line in the left antecubital region. During shift report, nurses noted that the extremity was taut and the infant was irritable. The nurses further assessed the site and removed the IV. Prior to ending her shift, the nurse placed a warm compress on the infiltrate site and notified the resident physician.

Within the next hour, the nurse coming on shift assessed the infant further and discovered redness and a burn at the site as a result of the warm compress. The compress was removed, and the physician called a surgical consultant for further evaluation. The infant was treated with topical ointment; no surgical intervention was necessary.

================================================================================

Title: Deaths Not Foretold: Are Unexpected Deaths Useful Patient Safety Signals?

The Case:
An 87-year-old woman with hypercholesterolemia, 	osteoporosis, and mild dementia presented to the emergency department after 	a mechanical fall and was found to have a hip fracture. The patient had 	well-treated hypertension, good exercise tolerance, and no known heart 	disease. On physical examination, her vital signs were stable and she 	exhibited no evidence of delirium. She had normal renal function, a mild 	anemia, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) with evidence of old Q waves but no 	acute or dynamic changes. The patient was admitted for orthopedic surgery, 	and a formal preoperative assessment placed her at "low risk" (based on the 	Revised Cardiac Risk Index scale). The patient remained on metoprolol and 	simvastatin in addition to enoxaparin for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 	prophylaxis until her scheduled operation.

The patient had an uneventful preoperative period but 	suffered a pulseless electrical activity arrest in the operating room at 	the time of wound closure. Though she responded to resuscitative measures 	and remained in the intensive care unit the following day, she developed 	acute renal failure and shock liver. Based on previously expressed wishes, 	the family requested that the patient be made comfortable with no further 	interventions. At the family's request, no autopsy was performed; however, 	providers felt that the patient suffered a massive pulmonary embolus based 	on an intraoperative echocardiogram that suggested right ventricular 	strain. The death was unexpected, particularly given the patient's low 	preoperative risk, and the family and providers struggled to explain the 	outcome.

================================================================================

Title: Code Blue—Where To?

The Case:
An 80-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and schizophrenia was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry service for hallucinations and anxiety. On hospital day 2, he had sudden onset of confusion, bradycardia, and hypotension. He lost consciousness, and a "code blue" was called.

The inpatient psychiatry facility is adjacent to a major academic medical center. Thus, the "code team" (comprised of a senior medical resident, medical intern, anesthesia resident, anesthesia attending, and critical care nurse) within the main hospital was activated. The message blared through the overhead speaker system, "Code blue, fourth floor psychiatry. Code blue, fourth floor psychiatry."

The senior resident and intern had never been to the psychiatry facility. "How do we get to psych?" the senior resident asked a few other residents in a panic. "I don't know how to get there except to go outside and through the front door," a colleague answered. So the senior resident and intern ran down numerous flights of stairs, outside the front of the hospital, down the block, into the psychiatry facility, and up four flights of stairs (the two buildings are actually connected on the fourth floor).

Upon arrival minutes later, they found the patient apneic and pulseless. The nurses on the inpatient psychiatry ward had placed an oxygen mask on the patient, but the patient was not receiving ventilatory support or chest compressions. The resident and intern began basic life support (CPR with chest compressions) with the bag-valve-mask. When the critical care nurse and the rest of the code team arrived, they attempted to hook the patient up to their portable monitor. Unfortunately, the leads on the monitor were incompatible with the stickers on the patient, which were from the psychiatry floor (the stickers were more than 10 years old). The team did not have appropriate leads to connect the monitor and sent a nurse back to the main hospital to obtain compatible stickers. In the meantime, the patient remained pulseless with an uncertain rhythm. Moreover, despite ventilation with the bag-valve-mask, the patient's saturations remained less than 80%. After minutes of trying to determine the cause, it was discovered that the mask had been attached to the oxygen nozzle on the wall, but the oxygen had not initially been turned on by the nursing staff. The oxygen was turned on, the patient's saturations started to rise, and the anesthesiologist prepared to intubate the patient. Chest compressions continued.

At this point, a staff nurse on the psychiatry floor came into the room, recognized the patient, and shouted, "Stop! Stop! He's a no code!" Confusion ensued—some team members stopped while others continued the resuscitation. Although a review of the chart showed no documentation of a "Do Not Resuscitate" order, the resuscitation continued. The intern on the team called the patient's son, who confirmed the patient's desire to not be resuscitated. The efforts were stopped, and the patient died moments later.

================================================================================

Title: Toxic Tachycardia

The Case:
A 66-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension and breast cancer was admitted with abdominal pain. She complained of 3 weeks of progressive severe right-sided abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a few days of constipation. On physical examination, she was in distress secondary to pain and was afebrile but tachycardic. The abdominal exam was notable for diffuse tenderness on palpation without rebound or guarding. The pulmonary, cardiovascular, skin, and neurologic examinations were all unremarkable. All of her laboratory tests were normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with iodinated contrast was done, which revealed a normal appendix and a colon filled with stool with no obvious explanation for her pain or tachycardia.

Her abdominal pain and tachycardia persisted with no clear etiology. On hospital day 3, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was ordered to determine the cause of the tachycardia. The level was undetectable at Table.)

The patient had no evidence of thyroid storm. The iodinated contrast given for the CT scan could have exacerbated her thyroid disease but fortunately did not. Therapy for her hyperthyroidism was initiated, and she was discharged without complications.

================================================================================

Title: Coming Undone: Failure of Closure Device

The Case:
A 65-year-old man underwent coronary angiography because of atypical exertional chest pain and shortness of breath. He was found to have coronary artery disease with significant narrowing of the proximal left anterior descending artery and a number of narrowings more distally. A bare metal stent was placed in the proximal lesion. A number of attempts were made to place more distal stents, but they could not be positioned correctly. After the procedure, the femoral artery sheath was removed and hemostasis was achieved with the use of an angio-seal closure device. A cardiovascular surgeon was consulted that day, and bypass surgery was scheduled for 4 days later.

The day after angiography, the patient, who was now home, was active and playing with his visiting grandchildren. The next day, the patient developed bleeding from the catheter site in his groin. The bleeding was not stopped by local pressure, and he returned to the hospital, where he was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive. His hematocrit dropped from 42% to 36%, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large (14 cm) retroperitoneal hematoma. He was taken to the operating room, and it was discovered the angio-seal closure device had failed and the femoral artery puncture (arteriotomy) was repaired.

The patient subsequently had complications related to the retroperitoneal hematoma, including persistent fever, leukocytosis, ileus, and back pain. His coronary artery bypass surgery was delayed, and while hospitalized waiting for the procedure, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died.

================================================================================

Title: Discharging Our Responsibility

The Case:
A 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure (CHF) presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and fatigue. He had a long history of CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization and was known to the ED as a "frequent flyer." In fact, he had been discharged from the hospital just 3 days prior. On physical examination, the patient had a low oxygen saturation level with elevated neck veins and crackles on chest auscultation, all consistent with an exacerbation of his CHF.

When asked by the admitting physician what happened, the patient replied, "You know, I was feeling pretty good when I left here, but my breathing just got worse and worse." Upon further questioning, it became clear that the patient had been eating bags of potato chips, not restricting his fluid intake, and only intermittently taking his diuretics. Since discharge, he had gained 6 pounds.

The admitting physician realized that the patient had a poor understanding of his disease and how to care for himself outside of the hospital. In reviewing prior admissions, the physician discovered that the patient had never been given explicit discharge instructions about CHF and had received only a generic medical-surgical discharge instructions handout.

In the hospital, the patient was treated with diuretics, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and a beta-blocker, and he improved clinically. At the time of discharge, he was counseled on appropriate activity, diet, medications, his follow-up appointment, and weight monitoring. Subsequently, he did well and was not readmitted to the hospital for more than 2 months.
